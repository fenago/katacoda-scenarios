Cloud computing

OK. Let's start at the beginning. So, what actually is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is an IT paradigm that advocates the use of shared pools
of configurable resources and services provided over the internet. Those
services are provided on demand, rapidly, and with minimal management.
As a result, cloud computing allows for flexible architecture, optimized
resource usage, and the possibility of decoupling the infrastructure
provider from a consumer, enabling the separation of concerns. Let's
examine those statements in greater detail.

Resources provisioned on demand give you, as a developer or an
architect, flexibility in configuring your technical infrastructure.
Starting the project is cheap, as you don't have to begin with
infrastructure investments. Also, when your project is in production,
computing resources may be scaled automatically to fill your
application's demands. In each case, you are paying only for the
resources used.
