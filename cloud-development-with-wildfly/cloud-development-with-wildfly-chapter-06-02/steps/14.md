First, let's removed the`catalog-service`. In order to do that, we will need to use
the `oc` delete command. The command interface is the same as
the interface for the get operation. You will be able to delete an
object by directly specifying its name or use labels to indicate objects
that you want to delete. There are many objects related to a single
application, and we obviously don't want to delete them one by one. As a
result, we will use the label version of the `delete` command
for that:

Use the following code to clean everything up.
`oc delete all -l app=catalog-service`{{execute}}

```

```

`oc delete project petstore`{{execute}}

```

```
