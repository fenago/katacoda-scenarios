#### The private cloud

In the **private cloud**, the computing resources used to create the
cloud are dedicated to a single customer. The resources may be located
on-site or off-site, owned by the customer, or managed by a third party.
All of the resources are provisioned for a single client and are not
shared by multiple clients. Such a configuration allows for greater
control and security but requires the company to invest in and manage
the cloud resources, removing the decoupling benefit of the public
cloud.

#### The hybrid cloud

The **hybrid cloud** is a model in which public and private clouds are
connected together. As a result, you can take advantage of both
solutions. For example, you can run services that deal with sensitive
data on the private cloud, but use the public cloud to scale other
services.

### Note

We would like our cloud provider to provide cloud abstraction that will
enable users to see a homogeneous cloud view, abstracting away the
infrastructure details of the hybrid cloud. We will return to this
thought later, when we describe the architecture of OpenShift.

Let's now focus on another cloud characteristic, that is, the **service
model**.
