Before we can check the application, we have to do one more simple
thing. The services are not visible outside of the cluster, and as a
result, in order to use them, we have to expose them on the address
visible from the external network. OpenShift provides a tool that
enables us to use these routes. In the preceding view, click on the
**`Create route`** link, don't change anything, and click the
**`Create`** button. After that, you will be able to see the external
address of the service:
