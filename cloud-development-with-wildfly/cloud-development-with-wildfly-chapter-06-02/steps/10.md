Finally, it is time to start an application:

`oc new-app wildflyswarm-10-centos7~https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Cloud-Development-with-WildFly.git --context-dir=chapter6/catalog-service-openshift-h2/ --name=catalog-service`{{execute}}

We are fully aware that, at this point, these commands look cryptic. For
some time, we will use them as a magical service deployment spell. Don't
worry though, they will be fully explained in coming lab,
and you will be able to understand each part of the process. To give you
a quick overview now: we are making OpenShift create a build of our
service directly from source code. In order to do that, we have to
specify the GitHub repository. Because our book repository contains many
subdirectories, we have to specify the subdirectory in which this
example is locatedâ€”we use `--context-dir` for that. We also
provide the name, using the `--name` command.
