Catalog-service on the OpenShift example
----------------------------------------

* * * * *

We have covered a lot of theory in this chapter and have introduced many
concepts that will help you to better understand how OpenShift works
under the hood. It is finally time to try it in practice.

We will deploy a `catalog-service` with a `h2`
database. In this example, we will only use the web console and deploy
the applications from the book's code repository.

### Note

Examples reference: `chapter6/catalog-service-openshift-h2`

You can access the `OpenShift Web Console` by clicking `Dashboard` tab located right to the terminal window. You will be welcomed by the user login screen. Let's enter our
**`Username`** and **`Password`**.

Use the `developer` user, with `developer` password, to log in on the welcome page. We will be directed to the welcome screen, as follows:

Click `New Project` and add following data to create new project:

**Name:** `petstore`{{copy}}

**Display Name:** `petstore`{{copy}}

Enter **petstore** as the name of the project. In order to deploy
catalog-service to OpenShift, we will use the source-to-image build
using the CLI.
