The OpenShift architecture
--------------------------

* * * * *

So far, we have been talking in abstract terms. In this section, we will
give you an overview of the OpenShift architecture. As a result, you
will gain a practical understanding of the functioning cloud PaaS
infrastructure.

Let's start with a bird's-eye view architecture diagram:

The preceding diagram sketches the layers of OpenShift architecture.
**Docker** runs on top of the operating system and provides layers of
containers.Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable pieces
of software (*Further reading*, link 2) that can be run anywhere on the
cloud. Those containers are orchestrated by **Kubernetes**, which
provides a unified view of heterogeneous computing resources. Finally,
**OpenShift** builds on top of **Kubernetes**, providing developer tools
that automate most configuration tasks. If this short description
sounded cryptic to you, don't worry. Everything will be clear by the end
of this chapter.
