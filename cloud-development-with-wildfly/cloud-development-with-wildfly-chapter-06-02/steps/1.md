In the previous chapters, we showed you how to develop microservices with WildFly Swarm. In this chapter, you will learn how to deploy those services to the cloud, and you will use OpenShift to achieve that. However, why should we bother? What are the features and benefits of cloud computing? Let's start by saying a few words about it.

Before we move on to the next section, you need to be provided with some important information. This chapter describes a lot of theoretical concepts that explain the internals of OpenShift. Don't worry if some of those concepts sound too complex to configure because (spoiler alert!), in the end, OpenShift will do most of the stuff for you. The goal of this chapter is to provide you with knowledge, which will allow you to understand all the magic that OpenShift can do, and. In later chapters, modify, and reconfigure that behavior. So, let's begin.
