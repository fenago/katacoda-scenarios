### The cloud infrastructure deployment model

The cloud deployment model specifies how cloud infrastructure is
organized. Let's look at commonly used models.

#### The public cloud

The **public cloud** is a model in which services are provided over a
network for public usage.

Public cloud computing is sometimes described as an evolution of
computing resources into utility such as electricity. Using the example
of a power provider may give you an alternative insight into the topics
described in this paragraph: the power distribution company is
responsible, among other, for ensuring that the network can deal with
demand peaks, or provide network redundancy in case of traction
breakdown. However, in the end, we don't think about it too muchâ€”we
insert the plug into the socket when needed and get billed only for
electricity we used.

We shouldn't stretch that analogy too far though. Computing resources
are obviously not a commodity like electricity, and they cannot be
provided to everyone in a uniform manner because of different customer
requirements.

First of all, not all customers are able, for various reasons, to move
their workloads to the public cloud. One of the reasons may be the need
for a higher level of security or greater control over the architecture.
Such customers can take advantage of the private cloud discuss it.
