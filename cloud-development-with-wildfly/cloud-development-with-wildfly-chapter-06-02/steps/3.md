Furthermore, cloud computing introduces the separation of concerns. The
cloud provider becomes specialized in provisioning the infrastructure.
The developers are provided with the interface of the cloud
infrastructure and will use it for the development. As a result, they
don't need to be concerned with the details of the infrastructure
configuration as long as they comply with the interface provided by the
cloud. Cloud providers, on the other hand, have to compete to provide
the most convenient and robust cloud infrastructure while minimizing the
costs.

Throughout this chapter, we will describe the cloud interface provided
by OpenShift. Before that, we will describe the following two cloud
infrastructure characteristics, which will enable the use of a
consistent set of concepts during the following chapters: deployment and
service models. Let's start with the first one.
