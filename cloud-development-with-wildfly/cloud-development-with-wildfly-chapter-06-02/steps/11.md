For now, let's use the web console to check whether the application has
been deployed.

Login to the web console again and navigate to
**`Builds | `****`Builds`** on the left-hand side. You will be able to
see that the build has indeed started:

Wait till the build has finished, then navigate to
**`Applications | `****`Services`**, and select **`catalog-service`**:

As you can see in the preceding screenshot, OpenShift has deployed the
application on one pod and made a service for it.
