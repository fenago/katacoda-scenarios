We may now check that the data is coming from database. Let's get into
the web console and terminate catalog-service pod. In
order to do that, enter web console,
click on **`Actions`** in the right, upper corner and choose
**`Delete`**. Repeat those actions for **`catalog-service`** pod. After
pod has been restarted (you can monitor that in
**`Applications | `****`Pods`** view), you can again list all items. You
should be able to see extract the same result as on the preceding
screenshot.
