After the application starts, we have to wait till it has been deployed
in the cloud. Let's use `curl` to `POST` new Item in
our store:

`curl -d '{"name":"rabbit","description":"Small mammal which jumps alot","quantity":"7"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST catalog-service-petstore.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/item`{{execute}}

Everything seems fine, so let's check what items are available in the
store using the request that we have just implemented:

`curl catalog-service-petstore.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/item`{{execute}}

There are three rabbits in our database. Our service is working
correctly inside the OpenShift cluster.
