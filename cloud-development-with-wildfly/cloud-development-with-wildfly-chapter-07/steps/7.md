Please note, that we have changed the convention here. Instead of using
names as item identifiers, we start using UIDs we will be the consistent
ID for pets in the whole application. Finally, we are going to execute
the script:


```
psql -U catalog catalogdb < items.sql
```

The command above run PostgreSQL command line client. The
`-U`Â parameter specifies the user (catalog in our example) and
the `catalogdb` parameter specifies the schema on which the
client must operate.
