We have extended the service with the `add` method (1). Note
that the method is transactional and generates UUID for the items in the
store (2). We have also added a method that lists all the items in the
store (3). Note that we would need also to add NamedQuery for that:


```
(...)

@Entity
@Table(name = "item")
@NamedQueries({
@NamedQuery(name="Item.findById",
query="SELECT i FROM Item i WHERE i.itemId = :itemId"),
        @NamedQuery(name="Item.findAll",
                query="SELECT i FROM Item i")
})
public class Item {
(...)
```
