To start with, ensure that you have logged in to the
cluster, as follows:

`oc login -u developer -p developer --insecure-skip-tls-verify [[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com`{{execute}}

# Output

```
Login successful.
```

Then, you need to execute the following command:

`oc project petstore`{{execute}}

`oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildfly-swarm/sti-wildflyswarm/master/1.0/wildflyswarm-sti-all.json`{{execute}}

The preceding command creates a bunch of OpenShift objects that are
necessary to start an OpenShift build.

**Important:** Please wait for build to comeplete before starting application. You can get build status by running  `oc get build --watch`{{execute}}
