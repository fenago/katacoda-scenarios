You can access the `OpenShift Web Console` by clicking `Dashboard` tab located right to the terminal window. You will be welcomed by the user login screen. Let's enter our
**`Username`** and **`Password`**.

Use the `developer` user, with `developer` password, to log in on the welcome page. We will be directed to the welcome screen, as follows:

Click `New Project` and add following data to create new project:

**Name:** `petstore`{{copy}}

**Display Name:** `petstore`{{copy}}

Enter **petstore** as the name of the project. In order to deploy
catalog-service to OpenShift, we will use the source-to-image build
using the CLI. To start with, ensure that you have logged in to the
cluster, as follows:

`oc login -u developer -p developer`{{execute}}

# Output

```
Login successful.
```

Then, you need to execute the following command:

`oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildfly-swarm/sti-wildflyswarm/master/1.0/wildflyswarm-sti-all.json`{{execute}}

The preceding command creates a bunch of OpenShift objects that are
necessary to start an OpenShift build.

**Important:** Please wait for build to comeplete before starting application. You can get buildsattus by running  `oc get build --watch`{{execute}}
