We have to create a route. After doing
that, let's find out the address of **`catalog-service`** visible from
outside the cluster:

`oc expose svc/catalog-service`{{execute}}

`oc get route `{{execute}}

Let's copy the route name and use `curl` to check whether we
can get pet information using **`catalog-service`**:

`curl catalog-service-petstore.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/item/dbf67f4d-f1c9-4fd4-96a8-65ee1a22b9ff`{{execute}}
