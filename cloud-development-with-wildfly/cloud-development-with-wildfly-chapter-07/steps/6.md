The application is running. Let's fill our database with a number of
pets so that we can test our service behavior. To do that we need to get
access to the console of the container on which the database run. In
order to achieve that we have to go to applications/pods menu, choose
the pod on which PostgreSQL runs, and the terminal button:

Let's fill the database now. Let's log into the user directory and
create the SQL script there:


```
cd
vi items.sql
```

The script is very similar to the load scripts that we created in
previous applications:
