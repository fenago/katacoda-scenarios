Let's deploy our application to OpenShift.

We will use the source-to-image build again as we did in the last
chapter:

`oc new-app wildflyswarm-10-centos7~https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Cloud-Development-with-WildFly.git --context-dir=chapter7/catalog-service-openshift-postgresql/ --name=catalog-service`{{execute}}

We have to wait till our fat-JAR has started. To verify that, we may
take a look at the log of the pod on which the application was started:
