Finally, take a look at the last image: `cd ../image2`{{execute}}

```
#1
FROM middle 
#2
COPY C C
```

`docker build -t last .`{{execute}}


It derives from the middle image (`#1`) and copies the
`C` directory (`#2`) from the local filesystem to
the image.

The following diagram presents the layers of the top image. We have
included all the commands from the image hierarchy so that you can take
a look at how the top image is assembled from scratch:

As you will notice in the preceding diagram, each command from all the
`Dockerfiles` is translated into an additional layer. The base
image, for example, derives from the `centos:7` images and, as
a result, its first layer is added on top of `centos` layers.
Similarly, the top image is based on the middle image, and as a result,
the layer resulting from the execution of the `COPY C` command
is added on top of layers from the middle image.
