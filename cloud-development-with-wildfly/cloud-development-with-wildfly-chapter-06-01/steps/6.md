### Kernel isolation tools

The Linux kernel provides a wide array of tools that enable the
isolation of processes, and put a resource usage limit on those groups.
The main tools that enable that (and are used by Docker containers) are
namespaces (isolation), and `cgroups` (limits). Let's learn
more about it.

#### Namespaces

Each kernel process can be assigned to a namespace—processes with the
same namespace share the same view some of the system resources. For
example, a PID namespace provides the ability to isolate
processes—processes in the same PID namespace can see each other, but
cannot see processes from different namespaces.

There is a group of namespaces in Linux kernel that provides PID,
network, mount point, and username isolation.
