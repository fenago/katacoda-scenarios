The preceding example gives you a bird's-eye view of the behavior of
containers and images. Let's now take a closer look at the architecture
of both.

Images are described by `Dockerfiles`. A
`Dockerfile` is a text file, which contains a list of commands
that instruct you on how to assemble an image.

Images have a layered structure. The commands executed in a
`Dockerfile` result in the creation of additional layersâ€”every
subsequent layer is different from the previous one.

Every image must derive from another image (possibly, an explicitly
empty *scratch* image), and it adds its layers on top of it. Image
layers are built directly on top of the kernel code.

Let's clarify all those concepts by taking a look at a practical
example. We will create a bunch of simple images.
