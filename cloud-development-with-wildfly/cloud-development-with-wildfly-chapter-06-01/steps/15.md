When we start the container based on an image, we are inserting another
layer on top of an image from which the container was started. The
container will write its changes to this layer, but the result won't
change the image, which is immutable. To understand why this is the
case, we must understand how layers influence filesystem behavior at
runtime. Let's find out.

When Docker starts a container, it creates a filesystem that will be
mounted as the root filesystem of the container. Such a filesystem
overlays all the layers from the image and the writable layer, creating
the filesystem that appears to combine the files and directories from
all the layers that constitute the image. Let's return to our example to
show how it works.

Let's create three containers based on the images from our previous
example:

In the preceding diagram, the top rectangle represents the images that
we have created. The middle image has added two layers corresponding to
directories `A` and `B`. The top image has added one
layer with the `C` directory. There are three containers. Two
containers (**2** and **3**) are based on the top image, and
**CONTAINER1** is based on the middle image. The rectangles at the
bottom represent each container's writable layer.

Since all layers have been combined into one filesystem, all containers
will see the whole operating system distribution. The content of the
home directory will be different for **CONTAINER1**, **CONTAINER2**, and
**CONTAINER3**: **CONTAINER1** will see only `A` and
`B` directories in its `home` folder, whereas
**CONTAINER2** and **CONTAINER3** will see `A`, `B`,
and `C` directories.
