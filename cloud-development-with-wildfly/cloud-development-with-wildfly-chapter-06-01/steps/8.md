You have just learned that the Linux kernel provides tools that enable
isolation of resources, laying the ground for the following the
implementation of system-level virtualization. But we have to ask
ourselves some questions: which applications will be run inside the
container? Which libraries and files will be visible in individual
containers?

To answer these questions, we will introduce you to Docker images. As we
have hinted at before, virtual machines in hardware virtualization can
be stored as images, which make it possible to store the state of the
virtual machine and, as a result, allow for the creation of reusable
preconfigured virtual machines and portability.

The same feature concerns containers and the implementation that we will
use: Docker. As you will learn in the following sections, this idea has
been developed to a whole different level, providing us with an
efficient and convenient image ecosystem and, as a result it, provides a
base environment for our cloud infrastructure. However, let's start at
the beginning.
