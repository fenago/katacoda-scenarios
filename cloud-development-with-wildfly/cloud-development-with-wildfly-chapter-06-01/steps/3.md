Why is virtualization important to the cloud provider, then?

Firstly, the cloud provider is able to provide access to the virtual
machine to the user.As a result, the user will obtain access to a
fraction of server resources.From the user's perspective, they will have
access to the isolated server

Secondly, the user has the ability to use a preconfigured image of the
platform that they want to use. Do you need Fedora with WildFly AS?Here
is your configured image.We will run it on our server, and you are ready
to go.

Thirdly, the cloud provider is able to optimize the resource usage.There
can be many virtual machines running on one server, minimizing the idle
time.

Fourthly, Virtual machines can be moved freely between different servers
when necessary.If more resources are needed, some virtual machines can
be transferred to another server.Again, from the user's point of view,
you will have access to an isolated preconfigured server and won't have
to worry about the details.
