As you can see, Docker is a tool that provides a number of capabilities
that are essential building blocks for our cloud architecture, as
follows:

-   The isolation implemented on the operating system level, combined
    with a layered filesystem implementation, makes it possible to share
    server resources effectively and allows for immediate container
    startup.
-   The image ecosystem provides a vast number of images that can be
    downloaded and used immediately.
-   The containers run from the same images and operate on different
    Docker environments, providing consistency in all your environments.
    As you will learn in the rest of this chapter, this is the key
    feature of a dynamic cloud environment.

All these features make Docker containers a great building block for
cloud infrastructure. However, we need more than that. First, there will
be a lot of containers in nontrivial environments. We are aiming for a
dynamic environment, which enables, among other things, automatic
scaling, high availability, and continuous integration as we expect a
large number of those containers to be started and stopped within short
periods of time. Finally, no matter how cool and efficient Docker images
are, we would preferably like to generate them automatically during the
build of our applications. All of those issues are resolved for you by
OpenShift.
