Let's return to the build process of our example container. When we were
building the base image for the first time, the following could be seen
in the build log:

```
Step 1 : FROM fedora:26 
Trying to pull repository docker.io/library/fedora ...  
sha256:b27b4c551b1d06be25a3c76c1a9ceefd7ff189f6f8b1711d3e4b230c2081bff3: Pulling from docker.io/library/fedora 
Digest: sha256:b27b4c551b1d06be25a3c76c1a9ceefd7ff189f6f8b1711d3e4b230c2081bff3 
Status: Downloaded newer image for docker.io/fedora:26
(...)
```

As it turns out, the `fedora:26` images were downloaded from
the `docker.io` server. Which service that enables users to
download images?

Docker images, just like Maven artifacts or operating system packages,
create an ecosystem of interconnected reusable entities. Just like in a
Maven or operating system scenario, we need a service that will store
and distribute such images. Such service is called a Docker registry.

Docker provides a default registry called DockerHub. DockerHub is a
publicly available free registry. If not configured, Docker will use
DockerHub as the default registry.
