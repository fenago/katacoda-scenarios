### Containers

Containers are the implementation of a system-level virtualization (or
paravirtualization). In this kind of virtualization, the operating
system is not emulated on each virtual machine. Instead, virtual
machines share the same operating system instance, using the tools
provided by it to achieve isolation. As a result, in this model, we can
think of virtual machines as isolated user-space instances running on
top of the same operating system. Such instances are called container.

The preceding diagram highlights the main differences between full
virtualization and containers. Containers share the same operating
system and, as you will learn in the next sections, are able to share
common libraries effectively. In the preceding diagram, the horizontal
line represents the layers that have to be created when the new virtual
machine/container is created.

Before we describe the Docker implementation of containers, let's talk
about the isolation tools that the Linux kernel provides.
