The `cgroups` are responsible for limiting the resource usage
for the group of processes. `cgroups` allow you to assign
processes to a number of groups and configure a resource quota for those
groups. The resources that can be controlled are, among others, CPU,
memory usage, network, and disk bandwidths. In the event of resource
congestion, the `cgroups` mechanism will make sure that the
group won't exceed its quota for that resource.

**Note**

In the case of containers, a group may be created for each container. As
a result, we would be able to provide a quota for all of the containers.
We may, for example, assign 1/5 of the CPU to one of the containers.
This would guarantee that, in the case of a congestion, this container
would have access to that amount of the CPU cycles. As a result, we are
able to guarantee resource access. The `cgroups` limit is only
enforced during the congestion. In our example, if all other containers
are idle, the container that was assigned a fraction of CPU quota may
use more CPU cycles.
