Firstly, we will create a number of files in the local directory from
which we will build the images:

Run following commands to create directeries and files:

`mkdir -p "./base" && touch "./base/Dockerfile"`{{execute}}

`mkdir -p "./image1/A" && touch "./image1/A/A.txt"`{{execute}}

`mkdir -p "./image1/B" && touch "./image1/B/B.txt" && touch "./image1/Dockerfile"`{{execute}}

`mkdir -p "./image2/C" && touch "./image2/C/C.txt" && touch "./image2/Dockerfile"`{{execute}}

`apt-get update`{{execute}}

`apt-get install -y tree`{{execute}}

`tree`{{execute}}
 
Let's create the first image now. `cd base`{{execute}}

```cat > Dockerfile << EOF
FROM centos:7
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash tomek 
USER tomek 
WORKDIR /home/tomek
EOF```{{execute}}


The preceding `Dockerfile` represents the base image. It
derives from the `centos:7` image, which is a bare Centos
distribution, adds the `tomek` user (`#2`), and
switches the previous user to `tomek` so that all subsequent
commands will be run as this user (`#3`), therefore the
directory from any further commands will be executed to
`tomek`'s `homedir`.

In order to build an image from `Dockerfile`, we have to
execute the following command in the directory in which the image is
located:

`docker build -t base .`{{execute}}

In the preceding command, we have tagged the image as base. As a result,
we are able to refer to it by its base name.
