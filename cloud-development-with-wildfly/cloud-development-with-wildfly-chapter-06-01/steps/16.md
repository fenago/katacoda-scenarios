Let's explain how this overlay is implemented. When a container reads a
file, the storage driver (a component responsible for the union
filesystem implementation) looks for that file starting from the top
layer. If the file is not found, it moves to the layer below it. The
cycle repeats till either the file is found or there are no more layers.
If a file is not found in any of the layers, we will get a
`File not found` error.

Let's suppose that **CONTAINER1** wants to read a
`~/C/c.txt`file. The storage driver starts searching in
**CONTAINER3**'s writable layer. Since the file is not there, it moves
to the `COPY C` layer from the top image. The file is found
there and is read.

What happens if **CONTAINER1** wants to read the same file?

The storage driver starts from **CONTAINER1**'s writable layer. Again,
it cannot find the file, but this time it moves to the
`COPY B` layer, which is the top layer of the middle image
from which the container was created. The file cannot be found there,
nor in any layers below it. We will end up with a
`File not found` a message.

What if **CONTAINER1** and **CONTAINER2** want to read
`~/B/b.txt`?

After reading the supposition in the preceding paragraph, you will know
that both files can be read. Note, however, that both containers were
reading the same file. The `"COPY B"`layer is reused by the
middle and top images, and the `b.txt`file reads from the same
image for both containers. Thanks to layers, containers are able to
reuse data.
