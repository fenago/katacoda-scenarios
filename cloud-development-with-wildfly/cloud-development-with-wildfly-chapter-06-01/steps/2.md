Virtualization is a technology that allows the running of many isolated
virtual machines on one server. A virtual machine is an emulation of a
computer system governed by the virtualization application running on
the server's operating system. The user to whom the virtual machine has
been provisioned has access to the fully operational host. The fact that
the host is not physical, and that it shares the resources of the
physical server with other virtual machines, is being abstracted away
from the user.

Another key feature of virtualization is the ability to serialize the
virtual machine into the image. This feature enables portability. The
image can be moved to different servers, thus ensuring that the state of
the virtual machine will be preserved.
