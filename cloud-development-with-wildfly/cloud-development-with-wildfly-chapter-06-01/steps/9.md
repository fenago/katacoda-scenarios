In Docker nomenclature, there is a distinction between an image and a
container. An image is an immutable, unambiguously identifiable
collection of files and metadata. A container, on the other hand, is a
runtime instance of an image. There can be many container instances of
the same image, each of which is mutable and has its own state.

Let's make it clear it with the help of an example. You can start a
Fedora distribution in a container. To do so, you have to download and
build a Fedora image. After the build, the image will be located on your
machine and will contain the Fedora distribution. As we mentioned in the
preceding paragraph, this image is an immutable template that can be
used to start a container. When you start the container based on the
Fedora image and log in to it, you will see that you have access to the
bare Fedora distribution. You can, among other things, install software
and create files there. When you do this, you modify only that specific
container. If you run another container from the same Fedora image, you
will again have access to the bare Fedora distribution.
