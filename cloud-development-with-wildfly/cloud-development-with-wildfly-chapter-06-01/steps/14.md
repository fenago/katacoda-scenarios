We now understand how `Dockerfiles` translate to the image
layer structure. However, why is this structure important? It is
important because it enables images to share the layers. Let's find out
how.

When we build the image, the commands from the `Dockerfile`
will be executed and all the layers will be created. As you saw in the
preceding example, images are connected to each other and can share
layers. A layer that is used by multiple images has to be created only
once.

In the preceding example, the middle and top images share all the layers
from the middle image. If we decide to build the middle image, all its
layers will also be created. If we later build the top image, none of
the middle layers have to be created again.

To understand why such sharing of layers is possible, we must understand
how the layers influence filesystem behavior after the container is
started.
