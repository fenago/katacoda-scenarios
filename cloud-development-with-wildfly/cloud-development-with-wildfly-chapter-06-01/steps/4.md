Then, what about the implementation?

Some of you may identify virtualization with hardware (of full)
virtualization. In this architecture, the virtualization application is
responsible for emulating the whole operating system with all the
necessary processes and libraries.

This solution has some performance problems, most of them resulting from
the fact that the operating system was initially designed to run on a
physical host. Firstly, to start the virtual machine the whole OS has to
be started and, as a result, the startup time may be substantial
(minutes). Secondly, OS processes and libraries have to be duplicated in
each virtual machine, which leads to non-optimal resources usage.

Let's think about it from the cloud provider's perspective, taking
special consideration of the microservices architecture,
*Java EE and Modern Architectural Methodologies*. We would like to have
a solution that will enable us to provide a large number of ephemeral
virtual machines. We would like to ensure that they can be started and
stopped immediately, optimizing the use of resources, and store image
data effectively. It turns out that we need another tool. Let's discuss
containers.
