Let's move on to the second Dockerfile: `cd ../image1`{{execute}}

```
#1
FROM base 
#2
COPY A A 
#3
COPY B B
```

Paste above content in Dockerfile inside `image1` directory.

The preceding image derives from the base image created before that. It
copies directories `A` (`#2`) and `B`
(`#3`) from our local filesystem to the image. Similarly,
let's build and tag the image:

`docker build -t middle .`{{execute}}
