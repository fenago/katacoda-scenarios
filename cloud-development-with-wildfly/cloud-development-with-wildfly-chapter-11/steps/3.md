When you develop your services for distributed environments, you must
take into consideration that invocations of the services will be
performed over the network. As a result, the application must be
prepared to deal with network failures, which will certainly happen.

This problem is further enhanced by the fact that a single misbehaving
service can poison a large number of services. Let's take a look at the
number of scenarios, that can make this possible.

### Dependent services

In large distributed systems, each service would have a large number of
dependencies on other services. It requires only one dependency to fail
to make the service irresponsible. Also, a service will go down too,
becoming unavailable for other services that depend on it. Such a
situation is known as cascading failures (Further reading, link 1).

However, that's not all. In a production-ready environment when there
are a lot of calls being performed, a service that has latency problems
will quickly block all available threads and make all other services
unreachable.

Clearly, if we want to design a robust distributed system, we will need
to have a tool that will enable users to deal with the problems
described previously. The tool that we will use is the Hystrix library.

Hystrix is a library developed by Netflix to deal with service failures
and to provide robustness for its sophisticated distributed
architecture. Let's find out how Hystrix deals with the problems
previously described.
