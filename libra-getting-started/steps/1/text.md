The Libra currency is built on the Libra Blockchain. This site documents Libra Core, an open source prototype of the Libra protocol, which powers this new blockchain. The site also documents the testnet, a demonstration of this new system. In contrast to the forthcoming Libra mainnet, the testnet uses a digital currency with no real-world value.

## Move
Move is a new programming language for implementing custom transaction logic and "smart contracts" on the Libra Blockchain. Because of Libra’s goal to serve billions of people one day, Move is designed with safety and security as the highest priorities.

## Libra Ecosystem
The Libra ecosystem consists of different types of entities:

1. Clients
2. Validator Nodes
3. Developers

**Clients**
A Libra client interact with the Libra Blockchain. Allows the user to construct, sign, and submit transactions to a validator node.

**Validator Nodes**
Validator nodes are entities in the Libra ecosystem that collectively decide which transactions will be added to the Libra Blockchain. 
A validator node maintains the history of all the transactions on the blockchain. 

**Developers**
The Libra ecosystem supports a wide variety of developers, ranging from people who contribute to Libra Core to those who build applications that use the blockchain.
