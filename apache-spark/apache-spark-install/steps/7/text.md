**Step 5:** Let us now test the Spark installation by accessing the Spark Shell. To do so, execute the following command.

`spark-shell`{{execute}}

**Note:** It might not work first time, Type `Ctrl` + `C` to quit and run `spark-shell`{{execute}} command again in that case.

Run `:q`{{execute}} to exit `spark-shell`.

Task is complete!
