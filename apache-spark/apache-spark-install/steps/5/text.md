Let us make a softlink to the spark directory so that we don't have to refer Spark with entire name as above. This will also be useful for the future updates. Execute the following command.

`ln -s spark-2.4.4-bin-hadoop2.7/ spark`{{execute}}

Run the following command again to check if we were able to create the softlink successfully.

`ls sp*`{{execute}}
