Let us begin this lab exercise by reading and writing text files in Spark using both DataSource API and RDD API. For ease and simplicity let us perform these tasks in Spark Shell.


#### RDD API
Let us first read and write text files to Spark using the RDD API.

**Step 1:** Download a text file from the URL below and save it in the path /home/scrapbook/tutorial/apache-spark/Files/chapter_10/. Please create new directories as required.

**Note:** We already have cloned a github repository which contains a required file. Open `apache-spark/Files/chapter_10` to view file.
