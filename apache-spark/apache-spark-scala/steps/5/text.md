After the installation is completed successfully, type scala in your terminal and you will be prompted with a Scala prompt.

`scala`{{execute}}

 The scala prompt is the interactive shell where you can write and run Scala code. This interactive shell is also known as `REPL`.

**Step 4:** You can now start writing Scala code! Let's start by printing the classic "Hello world!" from the shell. To do this simply type the following code and hit enter on your keyboard.

`println("Hello World!")`{{execute}}


As you can see from the screenshot, the output is shown below immediately as soon as you hit enter.

**Step 5:** To quit the Scala REPL, you use the following command.

`:q`{{execute}}


You are now back to the terminal prompt.

Task is complete!
