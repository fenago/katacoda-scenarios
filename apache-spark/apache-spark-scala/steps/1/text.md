Scala is short for Scalable Language. It is called scalable language because it is scalable as per the user requirement. Scala is a Functional as well as Object Oriented Open Source Programming language which runs on top of a `Java Virtual Machine (JVM)`. Scala is, as said above, the most preferred programming language for Spark, as `Spark` itself is built with Scala. Since Scala runs on top of a JVM, we can access Java libraries within the Scala code and utilize the functionalities of Java without being limited by Scala itself.

The compiler used to compile the Scala code is scalac. The Scala compiler compiles the Scala code to a byte code which is understood by a `JVM` to process the code. This is similar to how Java compiles its Java code using javac compiler to a byte code to process it on a JVM.
