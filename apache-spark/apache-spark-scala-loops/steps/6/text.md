Not only can we substitute the variables but we can also substitute expressions within the print statements enclosed in curly braces.

`println(s"Four divided by two is ${4/2}")`{{execute}}`{{execute}}

 
Scala also supports the printf statements similar to that of Java. All we have to do is use an f prefix in the printf statement. The example of the same is as shown below.

`printf(f"Printing the value of a double with 2 decimal places $decimal%.2f")`{{execute}}

 

Task is complete!
