**Step 1:** Now that we have editor to start writing the Spark code, the first thing we need to do is to include the import statements from Spark libraries. This program requires the following imports.

```
import org.apache.spark._
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext._
import org.apache.log4j._
```

The first two import statements are used to import the Spark packages and last import statement is used to set logging level for our Spark application.
