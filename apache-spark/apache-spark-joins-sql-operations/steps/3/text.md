Let us now use Spark SQL to join two dataFrames.

**Step 1:** Download the ratings.csv file from the URL below. This file contains four columns: userId, movieID, rating and timestamp.

ratings-head.csv - http://bit.ly/2FPdhHE

**Note:** We already have cloned a github repository which contains a required file. Open `apache-spark/Files/chapter_7` to view file.

**Step 2:** Download the movies.csv file from the URL below. This file contains three columns: movieID, movieName and genre.

movies-head.csv - http://bit.ly/2RTg72N

**Note:** We already have cloned a github repository which contains a required file. Open `apache-spark/Files/chapter_7/` to view file.

We shall join these datasets based on the movieID.
