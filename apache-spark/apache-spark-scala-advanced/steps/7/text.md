**Step 4:** We can also use the function literals in the parameters instead of using the name of the function as shown below.

`highSquared(6, x => x * x)`{{execute}} 

 
In the example above, we have used a function literal instead of referring name of another function. It basically does the same thing which we have seen in the previous step but in a different way. This is often used in Spark and it is very important that you understand what is going on here.
