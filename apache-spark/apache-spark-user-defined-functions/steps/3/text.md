Spark SQL has tons of built-in functions available to process data. These functions include aggregations, date-time functions, Math functions, String functions, collection functions and window functions. These built-in functions come handy and can be applied most of the time. But there can be scenarios which do not get satisfied with the usage of built-in functions. For such scenarios we can write our own functions called User-Defined Functions. We simply have to write these custom functions and register them with Spark SQL to be able to use them in our code.

We can classify such custom written functions in two types.

- User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
- User-Defined Aggregate Functions (UADFs)
