Next, we need to use the points in the latent space as input to the generator in order to
generate new images. The generate fake samples() function below implements this, taking
the generator model and size of the latent space as arguments, then generating points in the
latent space and using them as input to the generator model. The function returns the generated
images and their corresponding label for the critic model, specifically target = 1 to indicate
they are fake or generated.

```
# use the generator to generate n fake examples, with class labels
def generate_fake_samples(generator, latent_dim, n_samples):
# generate points in latent space
x_input = generate_latent_points(latent_dim, n_samples)
# predict outputs
X = generator.predict(x_input)
# create class labels with 1.0 for 'fake'
y = ones((n_samples, 1))
return X, y
```
