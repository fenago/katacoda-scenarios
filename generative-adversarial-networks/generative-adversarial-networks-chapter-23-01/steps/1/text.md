The Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN, is an approach to training a deep
convolutional neural network for image-to-image translation tasks. The careful configuration of
architecture as a type of image-conditional GAN allows for both the generation of large images
compared to prior GAN models (e.g. such as 256 × 256 pixels) and the capability of performing
well on a variety of different image-to-image translation tasks. In this tutorial, you will discover
how to develop a Pix2Pix generative adversarial network for image-to-image translation.
After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- How to load and prepare the satellite image to Google maps image-to-image translation
dataset.

Let’s get started.
