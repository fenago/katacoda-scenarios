The Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, or Wasserstein GAN, is an extension to the
generative adversarial network that both improves the stability when training the model and
provides a loss function that correlates with the quality of generated images. The development of
the WGAN has a dense mathematical motivation, although in practice requires only a few minor
modifications to the established standard deep convolutional generative adversarial network,
or DCGAN. In this tutorial, you will discover how to implement the Wasserstein generative
adversarial network from scratch. 


After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- The differences between the standard DCGAN and the new Wasserstein GAN.
- How to implement the specific details of the Wasserstein GAN from scratch.
- How to develop a WGAN for image generation and interpret model behavior.
