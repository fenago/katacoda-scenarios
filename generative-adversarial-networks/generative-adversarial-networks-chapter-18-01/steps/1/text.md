The Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN, is an architecture for training deep convolutional
models for generating synthetic images. Although remarkably effective, the default GAN
provides no control over the types of images that are generated. The Information Maximizing
GAN, or InfoGAN for short, is an extension to the GAN architecture that introduces control
variables that are automatically learned by the architecture and allow control over the generated
image, such as style, thickness, and type in the case of generating images of handwritten digits.
In this tutorial, you will discover how to implement an Information Maximizing Generative
Adversarial Network model from scratch.
