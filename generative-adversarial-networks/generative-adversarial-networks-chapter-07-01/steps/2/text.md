After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- How to define and train the standalone discriminator model for learning the difference
between real and fake images.
- How to define the standalone generator model and train the composite generator and
discriminator model.
- How to evaluate the performance of the GAN and use the final standalone generator model
to generate new images.
Letâ€™s get started.
