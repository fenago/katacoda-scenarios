When you are finished with your work you must close your instance. Remember you are charged
by the amount of time that you use the instance. It is cheap, but you do not want to leave an
instance on if you are not using it.
1. Log out of your instance at the terminal, for example you can type:
    `exit`
2. Log in to your AWS account with your web browser.
3. Click EC2.
4. Click Instances from the left-hand side menu.

5. Select your running instance from the list (it may already be selected if you only have
one running instance).
6. Click the Actions button and select Instance State and choose Terminate. Confirm
that you want to terminate your running instance.

It may take a number of seconds for the instance to close and to be removed from your list
of instances.
