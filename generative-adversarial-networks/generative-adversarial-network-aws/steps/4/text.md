Now that you have an AWS account, you want to launch an EC2 virtual server instance on
which you can run Keras. Launching an instance is as easy as selecting the image to load and
starting the virtual server. Thankfully there is already an image available that has almost
everything we need it is called the Deep Learning AMI (Amazon Linux) and was created
and is maintained by Amazon. Letâ€™s launch it as an instance.

-  Login to your AWS console if you have not already.

- Click on EC2 for launching a new virtual server.

- Select US West Orgeon from the drop-down in the top right hand corner. This is
important otherwise you will not be able to find the image we plan to use.

- Click the Launch Instance button.

- Click Community AMIs. An AMI is an Amazon Machine Image. It is a frozen instance
of a server that you can select and instantiate on a new virtual server.
