The process is quite simple because most of the work has already been done for us. Below is an
overview of the process.

- Setup Your AWS Account.
- Launch Your Server Instance.
- Login and Run Your Code.
- Close Your Server Instance.

Note, it costs money to use a virtual server instance on Amazon. The cost is low for
model development (e.g. less than one US dollar per hour), which is why this is so attractive,
but it is not free. The server instance runs Linux. It is desirable although not required that you
know how to navigate Linux or a Unix-like environment. Weâ€™re just running our Python scripts,
so no advanced skills are needed.

**Note:** The specific versions may differ as the software and libraries are updated frequently
