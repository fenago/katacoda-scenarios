Large deep learning models require a lot of compute time to run. You can run them on your
CPU but it can take hours or days to get a result. If you have access to a GPU on your desktop,
you can drastically speed up the training time of your deep learning models. In this project you
will discover how you can get access to GPUs to speed up the training of your deep learning
models by using the Amazon Web Service (AWS) infrastructure. For less than a dollar per hour
and often a lot cheaper you can use this service from your workstation or laptop. After working
through this project you will know:

- How to create an account and log-in to Amazon Web Service.

- How to launch a server instance for deep learning.

- How to configure a server instance for faster deep learning on the GPU.

Letâ€™s get started.
