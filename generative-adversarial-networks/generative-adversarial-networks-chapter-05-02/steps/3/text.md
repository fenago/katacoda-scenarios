We will run Jupyter Notebook as a Docker container. This setup will take some time because of the size of the image.

## Login
When the container is running, execute this statement:
`docker logs jupyter 2>&1 | grep -v "HEAD" `{{execute}}


This will show something like:
```
Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time, to login with a token:
    http://localhost:8888/?token=f89b02dd78479d52470b3c3a797408b20cc5a11e067e94b8
    THIS IS NOT YOUR TOKEN.  YOU HAVE TO SEARCH THE LOGS TO GET YOUR TOKEN
```

The token is the value behind `/?token=`. You need that for logging in.

**Note:** You can also run following command to get token directly: 
`docker exec -it jupyter bash -c 'jupyter notebook list' | cut -d'=' -f 2 | cut -d' ' -f 1`{{execute}}

Next, you can open the Jupyter Notebook at
