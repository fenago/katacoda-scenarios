Plots of generated images are created at the end of every epoch. The generated images at
the beginning of the run are rough.

After a handful of training epochs, the generated images begin to look crisp and realistic.

Recall that more training epochs may or may not correspond to a generator that outputs higher
quality images. Review the generated plots and choose a final model with the best quality
images.
