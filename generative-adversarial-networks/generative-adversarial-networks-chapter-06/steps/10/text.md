The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for several sample notebooks. Open and run `07_define_composite_model.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can also open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/07_define_composite_model.ipynb

**Note:**
Since algorithms are resource extensive. Please **shutdown** each notebook after running it [here](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work) before proceeding as shown below:
