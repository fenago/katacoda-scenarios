The Frechet Inception Distance score, or FID for short, is a metric that calculates the distance
between feature vectors calculated for real and generated images. The score summarizes how
similar the two groups are in terms of statistics on computer vision features of the raw images
calculated using the inception v3 model used for image classification. Lower scores indicate
the two groups of images are more similar, or have more similar statistics, with a perfect score
being 0.0 indicating that the two groups of images are identical.
The FID score is used to evaluate the quality of images generated by generative adversarial
networks, and lower scores have been shown to correlate well with higher quality images. In
this tutorial, you will discover how to implement the Frechet Inception Distance for evaluating
generated images. After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- The Frechet Inception Distance summarizes the distance between the Inception feature
vectors for real and generated images in the same domain.
- How to calculate the FID score and implement the calculation from scratch in NumPy.
- How to implement the FID score using the Keras deep learning library and calculate it
with real images.
