We can develop a Pix2Pix model to translate Google Maps images to plausible satellite images. This requires that the model invent (or hallucinate) plausible buildings, roads, parks, and more. We can use the same code to train the model with one small difference.

We can run the code now. Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `generative-adversarial-networks/chapter_23/06_train_pix2pix_reverse.py` to view file.

#### Run Code

Now, run the python code by running: `python 06_train_pix2pix_reverse.py`{{execute}}
