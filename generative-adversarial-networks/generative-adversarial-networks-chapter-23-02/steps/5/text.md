The output of
the model depends on the size of the input image but may be one value or a square activation
map of values. Each value is a probability for the likelihood that a patch in the input image is
real. These values can be averaged to give an overall likelihood or classification score if needed.
The define discriminator() function below implements the 70 Ã— 70 PatchGAN discriminator model as per the design of the model in the paper. The model takes two input images that
are concatenated together and predicts a patch output of predictions. The model is optimized
using binary cross-entropy, and a weighting is used so that updates to the model have half (0.5)
the usual effect. The authors of Pix2Pix recommend this weighting of model updates to slow
down changes to the discriminator, relative to the generator model during training.
