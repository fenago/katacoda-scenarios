Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are an architecture for training generative models,
such as deep convolutional neural networks for generating images. The generative model in the
GAN architecture learns to map points in the latent space to generated images. The latent
space has no meaning other than the meaning applied to it via the generative model. Yet, the
latent space has structure that can be explored, such as by interpolating between points and
performing vector arithmetic between points in latent space which have meaningful and targeted
effects on the generated images. In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a generative
adversarial network for face generation and explore the structure of the latent space and the
effect on generated faces. After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- How to develop a generative adversarial network for generating faces.
- How to interpolate between points in latent space and generate images that morph from
one face to another.
- How to perform vector arithmetic in latent space and achieve targeted effects in the
resulting generated faces.
