After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- The semi-supervised GAN is an extension of the GAN architecture for training a classifier
model while making use of labeled and unlabeled data.
- There are at least three approaches to implementing the supervised and unsupervised
discriminator models in Keras used in the semi-supervised GAN.
- How to train a semi-supervised GAN from scratch on MNIST and load and use the trained
classifier for making predictions.
Letâ€™s get started.

#### Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is divided into four parts; they are:
1. What Is the Semi-Supervised GAN?
2. How to Implement the Semi-Supervised Discriminator
3. How to Develop a Semi-Supervised GAN for MNIST
