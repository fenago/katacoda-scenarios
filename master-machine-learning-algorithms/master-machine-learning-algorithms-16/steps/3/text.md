Boosting is an ensemble technique that attempts to create a strong classifier from a number of
weak classifiers. In this chapter you will discover the AdaBoost Ensemble method for machine
learning. 

#### Boosting Ensemble Method
Boosting is a general ensemble method that creates a strong classifier from a number of weak
classifiers. This is done by building a model from the training data, then creating a second
model that attempts to correct the errors from the first model. Models are added until the
training set is predicted perfectly or a maximum number of models are added. AdaBoost was
the first really successful boosting algorithm developed for binary classification. It is the best
starting point for understanding boosting. Modern boosting methods build on AdaBoost, most
notably stochastic gradient boosting machines.
