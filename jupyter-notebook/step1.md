You will now run a Docker container for Jupyter Notebook. Note: this may take up to 3 minutes, because of the size of the container image.

## Run the Jupyter Notebook 

Run the Jupyter Notebook container image:

`docker run -p 8888:8888 -d --name lvlabenv fenago/lv-ml-jupyter:v1`{{execute}}

## Further prepare the container
To prepare the container we will run a script inside the container to install several Python packages

Run this script to execute these steps:
* copy the script prepareContainer.sh into the container
* copy the script, make the copy executable and then run the script inside the container - this will install several Python packages using pip
* restart the container

`sh df -h`{{execute}}

## Notes on what is happening under the covers
These are the individual steps inside this script. You do not have to execute them - because they are in the *runPrep.sh* script.

First, copy the script into the container
`docker cp prepareContainer.sh jupyter:/home/jovyan/prepareContainerRoot.sh`

This will copy the local file prepareContainer.sh into the container's directory `/home/jovyan` as prepareContainerRoot.sh; it will be a root owned file that cannot be run straightaway.

Next, copy the script, make the copy executable and then run the script inside the container:
`docker exec -d jupyter bash -c 'cp ~/prepareContainerRoot.sh ~/prepareContainer.sh && chmod +x ~/prepareContainer.sh'`

Next, run the script inside the container:
`docker exec -d jupyter sh /home/jovyan/prepareContainer.sh`

Finally restart the docker container
`docker restart jupyter`
