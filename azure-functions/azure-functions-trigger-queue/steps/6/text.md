Resources in Azure refers to function apps, functions, storage accounts, and so forth. They are grouped into resource groups, and you can delete everything in a group by deleting the group.

- In the Azure portal, go to the **Resource group** page.

    To get to that page from the function app page, select the **Overview tab** and then select the link under **Resource group**.

    To get to that page from the dashboard, select **Resource groups**, and then select the resource group that you used for this quickstart.

- In the **Resource group** page, review the list of included resources, and verify that they are the ones you want to delete.

- Select **Delete resource group**, and follow the instructions.

Deletion may take a couple of minutes. When it's done, a notification appears for a few seconds. You can also select the bell icon at the top of the page to view the notification.
