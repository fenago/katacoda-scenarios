**The App Service editor**
The App Service editor is an advanced in-portal editor that you can use to modify JSON configuration files and code files alike. Choosing this option launches a separate browser tab with a basic editor. This enables you to integrate with the Git repository, run and debug code, and modify function app settings. This editor provides an enhanced development environment for your functions compared with the built-in function editor.

**Console**
The in-portal console is an ideal developer tool when you prefer to interact with your function app from the command line. Common commands include directory and file creation and navigation, as well as executing batch files and scripts.
