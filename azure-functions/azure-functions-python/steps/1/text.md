In this scenario, you will learn how to build and publish a Java function to Azure functions with the Maven command-line tool. When you're done, your function code runs on the Consumption Plan in Azure and can be triggered using an HTTP request.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

**Note:** Creating an azure account is optional, if you don't want to publish your function on Azure.

#### Prerequisites
To develop functions using Java, you must have the following installed:

1. Java Developer Kit
1. Apache Maven, version 3.0 or above
3. Azure CLI
4. Azure Functions Core Tools
