The Weka machine learning workbench is a modern platform for applied machine learning. Weka
is an acronym which stands for Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. It is also the
name of a New Zealand bird the Weka. Five of the top features for using Weka are:
- **Open Source:** Weka is released as open source software under the GNU GPL. It is
dual licensed and Pentaho Corporation owns the exclusive license to use the platform for
business intelligence in their own product.
- **Graphical Interface:** It has a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This allows you to
complete your machine learning projects without programming.
- **Command Line Interface:** All features of the software can be used from the command
line. This can be very useful if you are looking to take your usage of the platform to the
next level and start automating common tasks.
- **Java API:** It is written in Java and provides a API that is well documented and promotes
integration into your own applications. Note that the GNU GPL means that in turn your
software would also have to be released as GPL.
- **Community:** The interface and algorithms are well documented and the large community
using the platform means that there is plenty of support if you need it.
