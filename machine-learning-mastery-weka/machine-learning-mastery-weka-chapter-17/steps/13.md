The C parameter, called the complexity parameter in Weka controls how flexible the process
for drawing the line to separate the classes can be. A value of 0 allows no violations of the
margin, whereas the default is 1. A key parameter in SVM is the type of Kernel to use. The
simplest kernel is a Linear kernel that separates data with a straight line or hyperplane. The
default in Weka is a Polynomial kernel that will separate the classes using a curved or wiggly
line, the higher the polynomial, the more wiggly (the exponent value).

A popular and powerful kernel is the RBF kernel or `RadialBasisFunction` kernel that is
capable of learning closed polygons and complex shapes to separate the classes. It is a good
idea to try a suite of different kernels and C (complexity) values on your problem and see what
works best.

1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Ionosphere dataset
You can see that with the default configuration that the SVM algorithm achieves an accuracy
of 88%
