By default a Gaussian distribution is assumed for each numerical attributes. You can change
the algorithm to use a kernel estimator with the useKernelEstimator argument that may better
match the actual distribution of the attributes in your dataset. Alternately, you can automatically convert numerical attributes to nominal attributes with the useSupervisedDiscretization
parameter.
1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Ionosphere dataset
You can see that with the default configuration that Naive Bayes achieves an accuracy of
82%

There are a number of other flavors of Naive Bayes algorithms that you could work with
