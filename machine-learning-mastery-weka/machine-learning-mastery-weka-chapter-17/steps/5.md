The algorithm can run for a fixed number of iterations (maxIts), but by default will run until
it is estimated that the algorithm has converged. The implementation uses a ridge estimator
which is a type of regularization. This method seeks to simplify the model during training
by minimizing the coefficients learned by the model. The ridge parameter defines how much
pressure to put on the algorithm to reduce the size of the coefficients. Setting this to 0 will turn
off this regularization.

1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Ionosphere dataset

You can see that with the default configuration that logistic regression achieves an accuracy
of 88%
