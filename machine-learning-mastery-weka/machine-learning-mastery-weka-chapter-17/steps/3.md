We are going to take a tour of 5 top classification algorithms in Weka. Each algorithm that
we cover will be briefly described in terms of how it works, key algorithm parameters will be
highlighted and the algorithm will be demonstrated in the Weka Explorer interface. The 5
algorithms that we will review are:
1. Logistic Regression.
2. Naive Bayes.
3. Decision Tree.
4. k-Nearest Neighbors.
5. Support Vector Machines.

These are 5 algorithms that you can try on your classification problem as a starting point.
A standard machine learning classification problem will be used to demonstrate each algorithm.
Specifically, the Ionosphere binary classification problem.
