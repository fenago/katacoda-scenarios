Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm. It assumes the input variables are numeric
and have a Gaussian (bell curve) distribution. This last point does not have to be true, as
logistic regression can still achieve good results if your data is not Gaussian. In the case of the
Ionosphere dataset, some input attributes have a Gaussian-like distribution, but many do not.

The algorithm learns a coefficient for each input value, which are linearly combined into a
regression function and transformed using a logistic (s-shaped) function. Logistic regression is a
fast and simple technique, but can be very effective on some problems. The logistic regression
only supports binary classification problems, although the Weka implementation has been
adapted to support multiclass classification problems. Choose the logistic regression algorithm:
1) Click the Choose button and select Logistic under the functions group
2) Click on the name of the algorithm to review the algorithm configuration
