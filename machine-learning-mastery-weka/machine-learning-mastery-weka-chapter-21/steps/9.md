You will see that 600 results were loaded. This is because we had 6 algorithm configurations
that were each evaluated 100 times, or 10-fold cross-validation multiplied by 10 repeats. We are
going to compare each algorithm configuration based on the percentage correct using pairwise
statistical significance tests. All of the default configurations. The base for comparison is the
first algorithm in the list, IBk with k=1 and distanceMeasure=Euclidean, the first algorithm
added to the experiment, also the default selection.
- Click the Perform test button in the Actions pane

You will see a table of results like the one listed below:
