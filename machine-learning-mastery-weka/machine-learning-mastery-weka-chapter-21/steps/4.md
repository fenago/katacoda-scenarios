In this tutorial we are going to define an experiment to investigate the parameters of the
k -Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm We are going to investigate two
parameters of the KNN algorithm:
1. The value of k, which is the number of neighbors to query in order to make a prediction
2. The distance metric, which is the way that neighbors are determined in query in order to
make predictions
We are going to use the Pima Indians Onset of Diabetes dataset.

This tutorial is divided into 3 parts:
1. Design The Experiment
2. Run The Experiment
3. Review Experiment Results

You can use this experimental design as the basis for tuning the parameters of different
machine learning algorithms on your own datasets.
