In this lesson you discovered how to design controlled experiments to tune machine learning
algorithm hyperparameters. Specifically you learned:

- About the need for algorithm parameters and the importance of tuning them empirically
to your problem.
- How to design and execute a controlled experiment to tune the parameters of a machine
learning algorithm in Weka.
- How to interpret the results of a controlled Experiment using statistical significance.

#### Next
After you discover the best performing algorithm for your problem, you need to finalize it. In
the next lesson you will discover how you can train your final model, save it to file, then later
load it and use it to make predictions on new data.
