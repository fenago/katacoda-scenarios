In this section we are going to define the experiment. We will select the dataset that will be
used to evaluate the different algorithm configurations. We will also add multiple instances of
the KNN algorithm (called IBk in Weka) each with a different algorithm configuration.
- Open the Weka GUI Chooser
- Click the Experimenter button to open the Weka Experiment Environment interface
