The results are fascinating. We can see that in general, the Euclidean distance measure
achieved better results than Manhattan but the difference between the base algorithm (k=1
with distanceMeasure=Euclidean) and all three Manhattan distance configurations was not
significant (no * next to the result values). We can also see that using Euclidean distance with
k=3 or k=7 does result in an accuracy that is better than the base algorithm and that this
difference is statistically significant (a little v next to the results). Is algorithm (3) with k=7
and distanceMeasure=Euclidean significantly better than the other results? We can perform
this comparison easily by selecting this algorithm as the basis for comparison:

1. Click the Select button next to Test base
2. Click the third algorithm down with k=7 and distanceMeasure=Euclidean
3. Click the Select button to choose it as the base
4. Click the Perform Test button to create a report of the results

You will see a table of results like the one listed below

We can see that difference of k=7 and Euclidean distance is statistically significant when
compared with k=1 with Euclidean or Manhattan distance, but not k=3 or 7 regardless of
the distance measure. This is helpful. It shows us that we could probably just as easily use
Manhattan or Euclidean distance with k=7 or k=3 and achieve similar results.

The chosen base algorithm does have the highest accuracy at 74.45%. It is possible that
this difference is statistically significant at a lower significance level, such as 20% (by setting
significance to 0.20), but the variance would be so high (better 4 in 5 random instances) that
the result might not be reliable enough. These results are useful in another way other than
seeking out the best. We can perhaps see a trend of increasing accuracy with increasing values
of k. We could design a follow-up experiment where the distanceMeasure is fixed with Euclidean
and larger k values are considered.
