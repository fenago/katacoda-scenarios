You cannot know which algorithm will perform the best for your problem beforehand so you
must try a suite of algorithms and see what works best, then double down on it. As such, it is
critically important to develop a baseline of performance when working on a machine learning
problem. A baseline provides a point of reference from which to compare other machine learning
algorithms.

You can get an idea of both the absolute performance increases you can achieve over the
baseline as well as lift ratios that show you relatively how much better you are doing. Without
a baseline you do not know how well you are doing on your problem. You have no point of
reference to consider whether or not you have or are continuing to add value. The baseline
defines the hurdle that all other machine learning algorithms must cross to demonstrate skill on
the problem.
