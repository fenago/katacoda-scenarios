It is important to have a performance baseline on your machine learning problem. It will give
you a point of reference to which you can compare all other models that you construct. In
this lesson you will discover how to develop a baseline of performance for a machine learning
problem using Weka. After reading this lesson you will know:
- The importance in establishing a baseline of performance for your machine learning
problem.
- How to calculate a baseline performance using the Zero Rule method on a regression
problem.
- How to calculate a baseline performance using the Zero Rule method on a classification
problem.

Letâ€™s get started.
