For a regression predictive modeling problem where a numeric value is predicted, the Zero
Rule algorithm predicts the mean of the training dataset For example, letâ€™s demonstrate the
Zero Rule algorithm on the Boston House Price prediction problem You can download the
ARFF for the Boston House Price prediction dataset.

1. Start the Weka GUI Chooser
2. Click the Explorer button to open the Weka Explorer interface
3. Load the /root/Desktop/numeric/housing.arff dataset
4. Click the Classify tab to open the classification tab
5. Select the rules.ZeroR algorithm (it should be selected by default)
6. Select the Cross-validation Test options (it should be selected by default)
7. Click the Start button to evaluate the algorithm on the dataset

The rules.ZeroR algorithm predicts the mean Boston House price value of 225 (in thousands
of dollars) and achieves a RMSE of 9.21. For any machine learning algorithm to demonstrate
that it has skill on this problem, it must achieve an RMSE better than this value.
