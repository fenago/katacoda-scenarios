For a classification predictive modeling problem where a categorical value is predicted, the Zero
Rule algorithm predicts the class value that has the most observations in the training dataset.
For example, let’s demonstrate the Zero Rule algorithm on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes
problem. 

1. Start the Weka GUI Chooser
2. Click the Explorer button to open the Weka Explorer interface
3. Load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff dataset
4. Click the Classify tab to open the classification tab
5. Select the rules.ZeroR algorithm (it should be selected by default)
6. Select the Cross-validation Test options (it should be selected by default)
7. Click the Start button to evaluate the algorithm on the dataset

The rules.ZeroR algorithm predicts the tested negative value for all instances as it is the
majority class, and achieves an accuracy of 651% For any machine learning algorithm to
demonstrate that it has skill on this problem, it must achieve an accuracy better than this value
