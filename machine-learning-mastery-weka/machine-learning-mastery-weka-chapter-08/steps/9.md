In this lesson you discovered the standard machine learning datasets distributed with the Weka
machine learning platform. Specifically, you learned:
- Three popular binary classification problems you can use for practice: diabetes, breastcancer and ionosphere.
- Three popular multiclass classification problems you can use for practice: iris, soybean
and glass.
- Three popular regression problems you can use for practice: longley, housing and sleep.

Now that we know how to load data, we can start working through problems. In the next lesson
you will discover how you can learn more about a load dataset by reviewing descriptive statistics
and data visualizations.
