An installation of the open source Weka machine learning workbench includes a `/root/Desktop/weka/examples/` directory full of standard machine learning problems.

This is very useful when you are getting started in machine learning or learning how to get
started with the Weka platform It provides standard machine learning datasets for common
classification and regression problems, for example, below is a snapshot from this directory:

All datasets are in the Weka native ARFF file format and can be loaded directly into
Weka, meaning you can start developing practice models immediately. There are some special
distributions of Weka that may not include the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/ directory. If you have chosen to install
one of these distributions, you can download the .zip distribution of Weka, unzip it and copy
the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/ directory to somewhere that you can access it easily from Weka. There are many
datasets to play with in the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/ directory, in the following sections I will point out a few that
you can focus on for practicing and investigating predictive modeling problems.
