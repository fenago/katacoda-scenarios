It is a good idea to have small well understood datasets when getting started in machine learning
and learning a new tool. The Weka machine learning workbench provides a directory of small
well understood datasets in your Weka installation. In this lesson you will discover some of
these small well understood datasets distributed with Weka, their details and where to learn
more about them. We will focus on a handful of datasets of differing types. After reading this
lesson you will know:
- Where the sample datasets are located or where to download them afresh if you need
them.
- Specific standard datasets you can use to explore different aspects of classification and
regression predictive models.
- Where to go for more information about specific datasets and state-of-the-art results.

Letâ€™s get started.
