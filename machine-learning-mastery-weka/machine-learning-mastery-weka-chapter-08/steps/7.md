**Note:** This jar has already been extracted at `Desktop`. You can verify by looking at `numeric` folder in kali linux desktop.

Regression problems are those where you must predict a real valued output. The selection
of regression problems in the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/ directory is small. Regression is an important class of
predictive modeling problem. As such I recommend downloading the free add-on pack of
regression problems collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is available from
the datasets page on the Weka webpage1 and is in the list called:
- A jar file containing 37 regression problems, obtained from various sources
(datasets-numeric.jar)

It is a .jar file which is a type of compressed Java archive. You should be able to unzip
it with most modern unzip programs. If you have Java installed (which you very likely do to
use Weka), you can also unzip the .jar file manually on the command line using the following
command in the directory where the jar was downloaded:
`jar -xvf datasets-numeric.jar`

Unzipping the file will create a new directory called numeric that contains 37 regression
datasets in ARFF native Weka format. Three regression datasets in the numeric/ directory
that you can focus on are discussed in the next step.
