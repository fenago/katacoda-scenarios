In this lesson you discovered how to find good and even the best machine learning algorithms
for your data problem. Specifically you learned:
- A process to spot-check a suite of different algorithms on a problem in order to find a
subset of algorithms that do well for further investigation.
- How to design and run an experiment to compare the performance of machine learning
algorithms on a dataset.
- How to interpret the results of a machine learning experiment in order to answer questions
about your problem.

Machine learning algorithms have a variety of parameters to configure. In the next lesson you
will discover how you can design controlled experiments to tune the parameters of machine
learning algorithms for performance on your datasets.
