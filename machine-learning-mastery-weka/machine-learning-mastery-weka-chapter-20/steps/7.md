The Weka Experiment Environment is a tool that you can use to run controlled experiments on
datasets with machine learning algorithms. The Weka Experiment Environment allows you to
define one or more datasets to work on and one or more algorithms to work on the dataset. You
can then run and monitor the experiment. Finally, all of the results are collected and presented
for you to analyze. In this section we are going to define an experiment with the Pima Indians
onset of diabetes dataset, 10-fold cross-validation (the default) and 5 common classification
algorithms.

Each algorithm will be evaluated on the dataset 10 times (10 runs of 10-fold cross-validation)
with different random number seeds. This will give in 10 slightly different results for each
evaluated algorithm, a small population that we can interpret using statistical methods later.
