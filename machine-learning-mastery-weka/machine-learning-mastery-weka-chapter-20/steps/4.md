The process is as follows:
- Design a test harness including the training dataset and any data preparation and the test
options, such as 10-fold cross-validation. For bonus points repeat the experiment with a
number of different presentation or views of your dataset. This will help to best expose
the structure of the problem to algorithms that are receptive to learning it.
- Select a suite of diverse algorithms with very different assumptions about the problem, such
as linear models, trees, instance-based methods, probabilistic methods, neural networks
and more. For bonus points allow each algorithm to put its best foot forward, including
variations of each algorithm with different commonly used configuration schemes.
- Evaluate the suite of algorithms on your training dataset.
- Analyze the results and identify 2-to-3 different algorithms on which to investigate further.

This process will always lead you to algorithms that perform well on your machine learning
problem. In practice, you really just need a model that does as well as possible, given the time
you have available. Finding the very best model for your problem is a matter of how much time
you are willing to invest trying different algorithms and tuning those algorithms that perform
well.
