The most common question in applied machine learning is: What algorithm is best for my
problem? The answer cannot be known beforehand. If you understood your problem well enough
to know which algorithm was best, you would not need to use machine learning. You would
simply solve your problem. Machine learning techniques are for those difficult problems where a
solution must be learned from data. Where traditional techniques cannot be used. There are a
lot of rules of thumb about choosing algorithms. For example, if an algorithm expects data of a
specific distribution and your data has that distribution, then perhaps the algorithm is a good
fit for your problem. There are two issues with this:

1. Many algorithms may have expectations that make them suitable for your problem
2. Sometimes good and even best results can be achieved when the expectations of an
algorithm are violated.

Rules of thumb are great for a starting point, but not the final choice of algorithm. The
best machine learning algorithm for your problem is found empirically. By trial and error. This
is done by evaluating a suite of algorithms of very different types on your problem, finding
what works well and doubling down on those 2-to-3 that show promise. I call this approach
spot-checking.
