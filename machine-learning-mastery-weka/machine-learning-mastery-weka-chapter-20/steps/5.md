You can spot-check machine learning algorithms on your problem in Weka using the Experiment
Environment. In this tutorial you are going to design, run and analyze your first machine
learning experiment. We are going to use the Pima Indians Onset of Diabetes dataset. We are going to evaluate 5 different machine
learning algorithms on the raw dataset:

- Logistic Regression (Logistic)
- Naive Bayes (NaiveBayes)
- Classification and Regression Trees or CART (REPTree)
- k-Nearest Neighbors or KNN (IBk )
- Support Vector Machines or SVM (SMO)
