Often, the experiment error will be caused by one of two reasons:
- You chose the wrong type of problem in the Experiment Type pane on the Setup tab of
the Weka Experiment Environment. For example your problem may be a Regression type
problem and you chose Classification.

- You added the wrong type of algorithm to the experiment in the Algorithms pane on the
Setup tab of the Weka Experiment Environment. For example, you may have added an
algorithm that only supports regression (like LinearRegression) to a classification type
problem.

When reviewing the errors in the Weka log, keep an eye out for messages that suggests one
of the above types of problems.
