Each algorithm will be evaluated using the default algorithm configuration Natural extensions of this experiment that you can investigate yourself are to:
- Create multiple different views of the dataset on which to evaluate the algorithms, such
as normalized, standardized and more
- Add more algorithms to the suite to evaluate
- Add more variations of each algorithm with common or standard algorithm configurations

This tutorial is divided into 3 parts:
1. Design The Experiment
2. Run The Experiment
3. Review Experiment Results
