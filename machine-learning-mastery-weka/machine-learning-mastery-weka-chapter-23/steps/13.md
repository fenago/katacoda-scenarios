In this project you completed your first machine learning project end-to-end using the Weka
machine learning workbench. Specifically, you learned:
- How to analyze your dataset and suggest at specific data transform and modeling techniques
that may be useful.
- How to spot-check a suite of algorithms on the problem and analyze their results.
- How to finalize the model for making predictions on new data and presenting the estimated
accuracy of the model on unseen data.

#### Next
You need to practice applied machine learning to get better. In the next project you will work
through a binary classification problem and investigate using multiple views of the dataset in
an effort to improve performance.
