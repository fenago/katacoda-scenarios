Looking across the graphs for the input variables, we can see good separation between the
classes on the scatter plots. For example, petalwidth versus sepallength and petalwidth versus
sepalwidth are good examples. This suggest that linear methods and maybe decision trees and
instance-based methods may do well on this problem. It also suggest that we probably do not
need to spend too much time tuning or using advanced modeling techniques and ensembles. It
may be a straightforward modeling problem.
