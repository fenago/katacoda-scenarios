The Weka machine learning workbench is so easy to use that working through a machine learning
project can be a lot of fun. In this section you will complete your first machine learning project
using Weka, end-to-end. This gentle introduction to working through a project will tie together
the key steps you need to complete when working through machine learning project in Weka.
After completing this project, you will know:
- How to analyze a dataset and hypothesize data preparation and modeling algorithms that
could be used.
- How to spot-check a suite of standard machine learning algorithms on a problem
- How to present final results.

Letâ€™s get started.
