Review the details about the dataset in the Current relation pane. We can notice a few things:
- The dataset is called iris.
- There are 150 instances. If we use 10-fold cross-validation later to evaluate the algorithms,
then each fold will be comprised of 15 instances, which is quite small. We may want to
think about using 5-folds of 30 instances instead.
- There are 5 attributes, 4 inputs and 1 output variable.

There are a small number of attributes and we could investigate further using feature
selection methods.
- Click on each attribute in the Attributes pane and review the summary statistics in the
Selected attribute pane.

We can notice a few facts about our data:
- There are no missing values for any of the attributes.
- All inputs are numeric and have values in the same range between about 0 and about 8.
- The last attribute is the output variable called class, it is nominal and has three values.
- The classes are balanced, meaning that there is an equal number of instances in each class.
If they were not balanced we may want to think about balancing them.

We may see some benefit from either normalizing or standardizing the data
