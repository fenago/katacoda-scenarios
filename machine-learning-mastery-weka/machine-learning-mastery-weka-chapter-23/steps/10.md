- In the Algorithms pane click Add new and add the following 8 multiclass classification
algorithms:
    * rules.ZeroR
    * bayes.NaiveBayes
    * functions.Logistic
    * functions.SMO
    * lazy.IBk
    * rules.PART
    * trees.REPTree
    * trees.J48

- Select IBk in the list of algorithms and click the Edit selected button
- Change KNN from 1 to 3 and click the OK button to save the settings
