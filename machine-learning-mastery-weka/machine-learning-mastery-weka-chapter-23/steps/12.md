We can create a final version of our model trained on all of the training data and save it to file
- Close the Weka Experiment Environment
- Open the Weka Explorer and load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/iris.arff dataset
- Click on the Classify tab
- Select the functions.Logistic algorithm
- Change the Test options from Cross-Validation to Use training set
- Click the Start button to create the final model

- Right click on the result item in the Result list and select Save model Select a suitable
location and type in a suitable name, such as iris-logistic for your model

This model can then be loaded at a later time and used to make predictions on new flower
measurements. We can use the mean and standard deviation of the model accuracy collected
in the last section to help quantify the expected variability in the estimated accuracy of the
model on unseen data. For example, we know that 95% of model accuracies will fall within
two standard deviations of the mean model accuracy. Or, restated in a way we can explain to
other people, we can generally expect that the performance of the model on unseen data will be
96.33% plus or minus 2 Ã— 3:38 or 6.76, or between `87.57%` and `100%` accurate.
