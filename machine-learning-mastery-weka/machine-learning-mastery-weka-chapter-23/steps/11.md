We can see that all of the models have skill Each model has a score that is better than
ZeroR and the difference is statistically significant The results suggest both Logistic Regression
and SVM achieved the highest accuracy If we were to pick between the two, we would choose
Logistic Regression if for no other reason that it is a much simpler model Let’s compare all of
the results to the Logistic Regression results as the test base

- Click Select for the Test base, select functions.Logistic and click the Select button
to choose the new test base Click the Perform test button again to perform the new
analysis

We now see a very different story. Although the results for Logistic look better, the analysis
suggests that the difference between these results and the results from all of the other algorithms
are not statistically significant. From here we could choose an algorithm based on other criteria,
like understandability or complexity. From this perspective Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
are good candidates. We could also seek to further improve the results of one or more of these
algorithms and see if we can achieve a significant improvement. If we change the Significance
to less constraining values of 0.50, we can see that the tree and KNN algorithms start to drop
away. This suggests we could spend more time on the remaining methods. Change significance
back to `0.05`. Let’s choose to stick with Logistic Regression. We can collect some numbers we
can use to describe the performance of the model on unseen data.

- Check Show std deviations to show standard deviations of accuracy scores
- Click the Select button for Displayed Columns and choose functions.Logistic, click
Select to accept the selection This will only show the results for the Logistic Regression
algorithm
- Click Perform test to rerun the analysis

We now have a final result we can use to describe our model

We can see that the estimated accuracy of the model on unseen data is 96.33% with a
standard deviation of 3.38%
