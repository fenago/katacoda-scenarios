- Click the Visualize All button and letâ€™s review the graphical distribution of each attribute

We can notice a few things about the shape of the data:
- We can see overlap but differing distributions for each of the class values on each of the
attributes. This is a good sign as we can probably separate the classes.
- It looks like sepalwidth has a Gaussian-like distribution. If we had a lot more data, perhaps
it would be even more Gaussian.
- It looks like the other 3 input attributes have nearly-Gaussian distributions with a skew
or a large number of observations at the low end of the distribution. Again, it makes me
think that the data may be Gaussian if we had an order of magnitude more examples.
- We also get a visual indication that the classes are balanced.
