If you have data in another format, load it in Microsoft Excel first. It is common to get data in
another format such as CSV using a different delimiter or fixed width fields. Excel has powerful
tools for loading tabular data in a variety of formats. Use these tools and first load your data
into Excel. Once you have loaded your data into Excel, you can export it into CSV format. You
can then work with it in Weka, either directly or by first converting it to ARFF format.
