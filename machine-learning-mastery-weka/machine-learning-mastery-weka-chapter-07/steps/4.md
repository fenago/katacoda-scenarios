Your data is not likely to be in ARFF format. In fact, it is much more likely to be in Comma
Separated Values (CSV) format. This is a simple format where data is laid out in a table of
rows and columns and a comma is used to separate the values on a row. Quotes may also be
used to surround values, especially if the data contains strings of text with spaces. The CSV
format is easily exported from Microsoft Excel, so once you can get your data into Excel, you
can easily convert it to CSV format.

Weka provides a handy tool to load CSV files and save them in ARFF. You only need to
do this once with your dataset. Using the steps below you can convert your dataset from CSV
format to ARFF format and use it with the Weka workbench. If you do not have a CSV file
handy, you can use the iris flowers dataset. Download the file from the UCI Machine Learning
repository and save it to your current working directory as iris.csv.

**Note:** You can save `iris.csv` file by running following command:

`docker exec -it kali-desktop bash -c "wget -O /root/Desktop/weka/examples/iris.csv https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"`{{execute}}

- Start the Weka GUI Chooser
