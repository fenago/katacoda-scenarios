A big benefit of using the Weka platform is the large number of supported machine learning
algorithms. The more algorithms that you can try on your problem the more you will learn
about your problem and likely the closer you will get to discovering the one or few algorithms
that perform best. In this lesson you will discover the machine learning algorithms supported
by Weka. After reading this lesson you will know:
- The different types of machine learning algorithms supported and key algorithms to try in
Weka.
- How algorithms can be configured in Weka and how to save and load good algorithm
configurations.
- How to learn more about the machine learning algorithms supported by Weka.

Letâ€™s get started.
