Clicking on the Choose button presents you with a list of machine learning algorithms to
choose from. They are divided into a number of main groups:

- **bayes:** Algorithms that use Bayes Theorem in some core way, like Naive Bayes
- **function:** Algorithms that estimate a function, like Linear Regression
- **lazy:** Algorithms that use lazy learning, like k-Nearest Neighbors
- **meta:** Algorithms that use or combine multiple algorithms, like Ensembles
- **misc:** Implementations that do not neatly fit into the other groups, like running a saved
model
- **rules:** Algorithms that use rules, like One Rule
- **trees:** Algorithms that use decision trees, like Random Forest
