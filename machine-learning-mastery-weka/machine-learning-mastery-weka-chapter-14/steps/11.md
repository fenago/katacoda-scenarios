Weka provides more information about each support machine learning algorithm On the
algorithm configuration window, you will notice two buttons to learn more about the algorithm

##### More Information

Clicking the More button will show a window that summarizes the implementation of the
algorithm and all of the algorithms configuration properties

This is useful to get a fuller idea of how the algorithm works and how to configure it. It also
often includes references to books or papers from which the implementation of the algorithm
was based. These can be good resources to track down and review in order to get a better idea
for how to get the most from a given algorithm. Reading up on how to better configure an
algorithm is not something to do as a beginner because it can feel a little overwhelming, but it
is a pro tip that will help you learn more and faster later on when you have more experience
with applied machine learning.
