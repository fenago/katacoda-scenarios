#### Linear Machine Learning Algorithms

Linear algorithms assume that the predicted attribute is a linear combination of the input
attributes
- **Linear Regression:** function.LinearRegression
- **Logistic Regression:** function.Logistic

#### Nonlinear Machine Learning Algorithms

Nonlinear algorithms do not make strong assumptions about the relationship between the input
attributes and the output attribute being predicted
- **Naive Bayes:** bayes.NaiveBayes
- **Decision Tree (specifically the C45 variety):** trees.J48
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (also called KNN:)** lazy.IBk
- **Support Vector Machines (also called SVM):** functions.SMO
- **Neural Network:** functions.MultilayerPerceptron
