Weka has a lot of machine learning algorithms. This is great, it is one of the large benefits
of using Weka as a platform for machine learning. A down side is that it can be a little
overwhelming to know which algorithms to use, and when. Also, the algorithms have names
that may not be familiar to you, even if you know them in other contexts. In this section we
will start off by looking at some well known algorithms supported by Weka. What we will learn
in this lesson applies to the machine learning algorithms used across the Weka platform, but the
Explorer is the best place to learn more about the algorithms as they are all available in one
easy place. The problem used for this example is the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset.

1. Open the Weka GUI Chooser
2. Click the Explorer button to open the Weka Explorer
3. Open the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff dataset
4. Click Classify to open the Classify tab

The Classify tab of the Weka Explorer is where you can learn about the various different
algorithms and explore predictive modeling You can choose a machine learning algorithm by clicking the Choose button
