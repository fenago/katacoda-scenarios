Generally, when working on a machine learning problem you cannot know which algorithm
will be the best for your problem beforehand. If you had enough information to know which
algorithm would achieve the best performance, you probably would not be doing applied machine
learning. You would be doing something else like statistics. The solution therefore is to try
a suite of algorithms on your problem and see what works best. Try a handful of powerful
algorithms, then double down on the 1-to-3 algorithms that perform the best. They will given
you an idea of the general type of algorithms that perform well or learning strategies that may
be better than average at picking out the hidden structure in your data.

Some of the machine learning algorithms in Weka have non-standard names. You may
already know the names of some machine learning algorithms, but feel confused by the names
of the algorithms in Weka. Below is a list of 10 top machine learning algorithms you should
consider trying on your problem, including both their standard name and the name used in
Weka.
