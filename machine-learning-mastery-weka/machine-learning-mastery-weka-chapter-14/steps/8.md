Ensemble methods combine the predictions from multiple models in order to make more robust
predictions
- **Random Forest:** trees.RandomForest
- **Bootstrap Aggregation (also called Bagging):** meta.Bagging
- **Stacked Aggregation (also called Stacking or Blending):** meta.Stacking

Weka has an extensive array of ensemble methods, perhaps one of the largest available across
all of the popular machine learning frameworks If you are looking for an area to specialize in
using Weka, a source of true power in the platform besides ease of use, I would point to the
support for ensemble techniques
