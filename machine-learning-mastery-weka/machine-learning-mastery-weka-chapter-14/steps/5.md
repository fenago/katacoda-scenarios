The tab is called Classify and the algorithms are listed under an overarching group called
Classifiers. Nevertheless, Weka supports both classification (predict a category) and regression
(predict a numeric value) predictive modeling problems. The type of problem you are working
with is defined by the variable you wish to predict. On the Classify tab this is selected below
the test options. By default, Weka selects the last attribute in your dataset. If the attribute is
nominal, then Weka assumes you are working on a classification problem. If the attribute is
numeric, Weka assumes you are working on a regression problem.

This is important, because the type of problem that you are working on determines what
algorithms that you can work with. For example, if you are working on a classification problem,
you cannot use regression algorithms like Linear Regression. On the other hand, if you are
working on a regression problem, you cannot use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression.
Note if you are confused by the word regression, that is okay. It is confusing. Regression is a
historical word from statistics. It used to mean making a model for a numerical output (to
regress). It now means both the name of some algorithms and to predict a numerical value.
Weka will gray-out algorithms that are not supported by your chosen problem. Many machine
learning algorithms can be used for both classification and regression. So you will have access
to a large suite of algorithms regardless of your chosen problem.
