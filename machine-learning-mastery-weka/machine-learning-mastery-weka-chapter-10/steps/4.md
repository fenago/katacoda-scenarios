This distinction makes a lot more sense. After you have selected a filter, its name will appear
in the box next to the Choose button. You can configure a filter by clicking its name which will
open the configuration window. You can change the parameters of the filter and even save or
load the configuration of the filter itself. This is great for reproducibility.

You can learn more about each configuration option by hovering over it and reading the
tooltip. You can also read all of the details about the filter including the configuration, papers
and books for further reading and more information about the filter works by clicking the More
button.

You can close the help and apply the configuration by clicking the OK button. You can
apply a filter to your loaded dataset by clicking the Apply button next to the filter name.
