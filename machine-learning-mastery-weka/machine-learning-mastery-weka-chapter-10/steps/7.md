Data standardization is the process of rescaling one or more attributes so that they have a mean
value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Standardization assumes that your data has a Gaussian
(bell curve) distribution. This does not strictly have to be true, but the technique is more
effective if your attribute distribution is Gaussian. You can standardize all of the attributes in
your dataset with Weka by choosing the Standardize filter and applying it your dataset. You
can use the following recipe to standardize your dataset:
- Open the Weka Explorer
- Load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff dataset
- Click the Choose button to and select the unsupervised.attribute.Standardize filter

- Click the Apply button to normalize your dataset
- Click the Save button and type a filename to save the standardized copy of your dataset
