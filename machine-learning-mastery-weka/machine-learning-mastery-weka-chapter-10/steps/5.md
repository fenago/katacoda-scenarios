Data normalization is the process of rescaling one or more attributes to the range of 0 to 1. This
means that the largest value for each attribute is 1 and the smallest value is 0. Normalization is
a good technique to use when you do not know the distribution of your data or when you know
the distribution is not Gaussian (a bell curve).

The dataset used for this example is the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. You can normalize all of the attributes in your
dataset with Weka by choosing the Normalize filter and applying it to your dataset. You can
use the following recipe to normalize your dataset:
- Open the Weka Explorer
- Load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff dataset

- Click the Apply button to normalize your dataset
- Click the Save button and type a filename to save the normalized copy of your dataset
