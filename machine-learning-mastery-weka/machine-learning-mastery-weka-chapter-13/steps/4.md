Feature selection is divided into two parts:
- **Attribute Evaluator**
- **Search Method**

Each section has multiple techniques from which to choose. The Attribute Evaluator is the
technique by which each attribute in your dataset (also called a column or feature) is evaluated
in the context of the output variable (e.g. the class). The Search Method is the technique by
which to try or navigate different combinations of attributes in the dataset in order to arrive on
a shortlist of chosen features. Some Attribute Evaluator techniques require the use of specific
Search Methods. For example, the CorrelationAttributeEval technique used in the next section
can only be used with a Ranker Search Method, that evaluates each attribute and lists the
results in a rank order. When selecting different Attribute Evaluators, the interface may ask you
to change the Search Method to something compatible with the chosen technique.
