Looking back over the three techniques, we can see some overlap in the selected features (e.g.
plas), but also differences. It is a good idea to evaluate a number of different views of your
machine learning dataset. A view of your dataset is nothing more than a subset of features
selected by a given feature selection technique. It is a copy of your dataset that you can easily
make in Weka. For example, taking the results from the last feature selection technique, letâ€™s
say we wanted to create a view of the Pima Indians dataset with only the following attributes:
plas, pres, mass and age:

- Click the Preprocess tab
- In the Attributes selection Tick all but the plas, pres, mass, age and class attributes

- Click the Remove button
- Click the Save button and enter a filename

You now have a new view of your dataset to explore
