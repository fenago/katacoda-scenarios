Raw machine learning data contains a mixture of attributes, some of which are relevant to
making predictions. How do you know which features to use and which to remove? The process
of selecting features in your data to model your problem is called feature selection. In this lesson
you will discover how to perform feature selection with your machine learning data in Weka.
After reading this lesson you will know:

- About the importance of feature selection when working through a machine learning
problem.
- How feature selection is supported on the Weka platform.
- How to use various different feature selection techniques in Weka on your dataset.

Letâ€™s get started.
