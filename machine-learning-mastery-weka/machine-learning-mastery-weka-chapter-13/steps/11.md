You cannot know which views of your data will produce the most accurate models. Therefore,
it is a good idea to try a number of different feature selection techniques on your data and in
turn create many different views of your data. Select a good generic technique, like a decision
tree, and build a model for each view of your data. Compare the results to get an idea of which
view of your data results in the best performance. This will give you an idea of the view or
more specifically features that best expose the structure of your problem to learning algorithms
in general.
