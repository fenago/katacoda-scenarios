The C parameter, called the complexity parameter in Weka controls how flexible the process
for drawing the line to fit the data can be. A value of 0 allows no violations of the margin,
whereas the default is 1. A key parameter in SVM is the type of Kernel to use. The simplest
kernel is a Linear kernel that separates data with a straight line or hyperplane. The default
in Weka is a Polynomial kernel that will fit the data using a curved or wiggly line, the higher
the polynomial, the more wiggly (the exponent value). The Polynomial kernel has a default
exponent of 1, which makes it equivalent to a linear kernel. A popular and powerful kernel is
the RBF kernel or Radial Basis Function Kernel that is capable of learning closed polygons and
complex shapes to fit the training data. It is a good idea to try a suite of different kernels and
C (complexity) values on your problem and see what works best.
