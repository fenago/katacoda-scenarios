The performance of linear regression can be reduced if your training data has input attributes
that are highly correlated. Weka can detect and remove highly correlated input attributes
automatically by setting eliminateColinearAttributes to True, which is the default. Additionally,
attributes that are unrelated to the output variable can also negatively impact performance.

Weka can automatically perform feature selection to only select those relevant attributes by
setting the attributeSelectionMethod. This is enabled by default and can be disabled.
Finally, the Weka implementation uses a ridge regularization technique in order to reduce
the complexity of the learned model. It does this by minimizing the square of the absolute sum
of the learned coefficients, which will prevent any specific coefficient from becoming too large (a
sign of complexity in regression models).

1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Boston house price dataset
You can see that with the default configuration that linear regression achieves an RMSE of 4.9
