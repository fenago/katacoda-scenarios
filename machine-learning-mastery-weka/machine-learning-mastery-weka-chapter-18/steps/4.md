Linear regression only supports regression type problems. It works by estimating coefficients for
a line or hyperplane that best fits the training data. It is a very simple regression algorithm,
fast to train and can have great performance if the output variable for your data is a linear
combination of your inputs. It is good idea to evaluate linear regression on your problem before
moving onto more complex algorithms in case it performs well. Choose the linear regression
algorithm:

1. Click the Choose button and select LinearRegression under the functions group
2. Click on the name of the algorithm to review the algorithm configuration
