You can manually specify the structure of the neural network that is used by the model, but
this is not recommended for beginners. The default will automatically design the network and
train it on your dataset. The default will create a single hidden layer network. You can specify
the number of hidden layers in the hiddenLayers parameter, set to automatic a by default. You
can also use a GUI to design the network structure. This can be fun, but it is recommended
that you use the GUI with a simple train and test split of your training data, otherwise you will
be asked to design a network for each of the 10-folds of cross-validation.

You can configure the learning process by specifying how much to update the model each
epoch by setting the learningRate. Common values are small such as values between 0.3 (the
default) and 0.1. The learning process can be further tuned with a momentum (set to 0.2 by
default) to continue updating the weights even when no changes need to be made, and a decay
(set decay to True) which will reduce the learning rate over time to perform more learning at
the beginning of training and less at the end.

1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Boston house price dataset
You can see that with the default configuration that Multilayer Perceptron algorithm achieves
an RMSE of `4.7`
