The depth of the tree is defined automatically, but can specify a depth in the maxDepth
parameter. You can also choose to turn off pruning by setting the noPruning parameter to True,
although this may result in worse performance. The minNum parameter defines the minimum
number of instances supported by the tree in a leaf node when constructing the tree from the
training data.

1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Boston house price dataset

You can see that with the default configuration that decision tree algorithm achieves an
RMSE of 4.8.
