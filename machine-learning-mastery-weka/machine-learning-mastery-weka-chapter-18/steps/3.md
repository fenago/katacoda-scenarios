We are going to take a tour of 5 top regression algorithms in Weka Each algorithm that we cover
will be briefly described in terms of how it works, key algorithm parameters will be highlighted
and the algorithm will be demonstrated in the Weka Explorer interface The 5 algorithms that
we will review are:
1. Linear Regression
2. k-Nearest Neighbors
3. Decision Tree
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Multilayer Perceptron

These are 5 algorithms that you can try on your regression problem as a starting point
A standard machine learning regression problem will be used to demonstrate each algorithm. Specifically, the Boston House Price Dataset

1. Open the Weka GUI Chooser
2. Click the Explorer button to open the Weka Explorer
3. Load the /root/Desktop/numeric/housing.arff dataset
4. Click Classify to open the Classify tab

Letâ€™s start things off by looking at the linear regression algorithm
