The Multilayer Perceptron algorithms supports both regression and classification problems. It
is also called artificial neural networks or simply neural networks for short. Neural networks are
a complex algorithm to use for predictive modeling because there are so many configuration
parameters that can only be tuned effectively through intuition and a lot of trial and error.

It is an algorithm inspired by a model of biological neural networks in the brain where small
processing units called neurons are organized into layers that if configured well are capable of
approximating any function. In classification we are interested in approximating the underlying
function to best discriminate between classes. In regression problems we are interested in
approximating a function that best fits the real value output. Choose the Multilayer Perceptron
algorithm:

1. Click the Choose button and select MultilayerPerceptron under the function group
2. Click on the name of the algorithm to review the algorithm configuration
