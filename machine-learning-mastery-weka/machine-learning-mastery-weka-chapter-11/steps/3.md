Some machine learning algorithms prefer or find it easier to work with discrete attributes. For
example, decision tree algorithms can choose split points in real valued attributes, but are
much cleaner when split points are chosen between bins or predefined groups in the real-valued
attributes. Discrete attributes are those that describe a category, called nominal attributes.
Those attributes that describe a category that where there is a meaning in the order for the
categories are called ordinal attributes. The process of converting a real-valued attribute into
an ordinal attribute or bins is called discretization.

You can discretize your real valued attributes in Weka using the Discretize filter. The tutorial
below demonstrates how to use the Discretize filter. The Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset
is used to demonstrate this filter because of the input values are real-valued and grouping them
into bins may make sense.

- Open the Weka Explorer
- Load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff dataset

- Click the Choose button for the Filter and select the unsupervised.attribute.Discretize
filter
