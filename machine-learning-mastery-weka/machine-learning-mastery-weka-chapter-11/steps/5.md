Some machine learning algorithms prefer to use real valued inputs and do not support nominal
or ordinal attributes. Nominal attributes can be converted to real values. This is done by
creating one new binary attribute for each category. For a given instance that has a category
for that value, the binary attribute is set to 1 and the binary attributes for the other categories
is set to 0. This process is called creating dummy variables.

You can create dummy binary variables from nominal attributes in Weka using the NominalToBinary filter. The recipe below demonstrates how to use the NominalToBinary filter.
The Contact Lenses dataset is used to demonstrate this filter because the attributes are all
nominal and provide plenty of opportunity for creating dummy variables. You can download
the Contact Lenses dataset from the UCI Machine learning repository. You can also access
the dataset directory in your installation of Weka under the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/ directory by loading the file
`contact-lenses.arff`.

- Open the Weka Explorer
- Load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/contact-lenses.arff dataset
