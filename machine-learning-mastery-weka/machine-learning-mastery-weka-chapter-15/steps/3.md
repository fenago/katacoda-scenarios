There are a number of model evaluation techniques that you can choose from, and the Weka
machine learning workbench offers four of them, as follows:

**Training Dataset**

Prepare your model on the entire training dataset, then evaluate the model on the same dataset.
This is generally problematic not least because a perfect algorithm could game this evaluation
technique by simply memorizing (storing) all training patterns and achieve a perfect score,
which would be misleading.

**Supplied Test Set**

Split your dataset manually using another program. Prepare your model on the entire training
dataset and use the separate test set to evaluate the performance of the model. This is a good
approach if you have a large dataset (many tens of thousands of instances).
