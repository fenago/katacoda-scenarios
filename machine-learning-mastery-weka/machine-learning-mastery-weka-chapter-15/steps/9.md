When evaluating a machine learning algorithm on a regression problem, you are given a number
of different performance measures to review Of note the performance summary for regression
algorithms are two things:
- **Correlation Coefficient** This is how well the predictions are correlated or change with
the actual output value. A value of 0 is the worst and a value of 1 is a perfectly correlated
set of predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error** This is the average amount of error made on the test set
in the units of the output variable. This measure helps you get an idea on the amount a
given prediction may be wrong on average.
