In this lesson you discovered how to estimate the performance of your machine learning models
on unseen data in Weka. Specifically, you learned:
- About the importance of estimating the performance of machine learning models on unseen
data as the core problem in predictive modeling.
- About the 4 different test options and when to use each, paying specific attention to train
and test splits and k-fold cross-validation.
- About the performance summary for classification and regression problems and to which
metrics to pay attention.

#### Next
When comparing machine learning algorithms on a dataset, you need a common point of reference
In the next lesson you will learn how to create a baseline for performance on classification and
regression problems
