In addition to the parameters listed above for bagging, a key parameter for random forest
is the number of attributes to consider in each split point In Weka this can be controlled by
the numFeatures parameter, which by default is set to 0, which selects the value automatically
based on a rule of thumb
1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Ionosphere dataset
You can see that with the default configuration that random forests achieves an accuracy of
92%
