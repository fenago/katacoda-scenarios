Bootstrap Aggregation or Bagging for short is an ensemble algorithm that can be used for
classification or regression. Bootstrap is a statistical estimation technique where a statistical
quantity like a mean is estimated from multiple random samples of your data (with replacement).
It is a useful technique when you have a limited amount of data and you are interested in a
more robust estimate of a statistical quantity.

This sample principle can be used with machine learning models. Multiple random samples
of your training data are drawn with replacement and used to train multiple different machine
learning models. Each model is then used to make a prediction and the results are averaged to
give a more robust prediction. It is a technique that is best used with models that have a low
bias and a high variance, meaning that the predictions they make are highly dependent on the
specific data from which they were trained. The most used algorithm for bagging that fits this
requirement of high variance are decision trees.

Choose the bagging algorithm:
1. Click the Choose button and select Bagging under the meta group
2. Click on the name of the algorithm to review the algorithm configuration
