Voting is perhaps the simplest ensemble algorithm, and is often very effective. It can be used for
classification or regression problems. Voting works by creating two or more submodels. Each
submodel makes predictions which are combined in some way, such as by taking the mean or
the mode of the predictions, allowing each submodel to vote on what the outcome should be.
Choose the Vote algorithm:

1. Click the Choose button and select Vote under the meta group
2. Click on the name of the algorithm to review the algorithm configuration
