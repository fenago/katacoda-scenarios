We are going to take a tour of 5 top ensemble machine learning algorithms in Weka. Each
algorithm that we cover will be briefly described in terms of how it works, key algorithm
parameters will be highlighted and the algorithm will be demonstrated in the Weka Explorer
interface. The 5 algorithms that we will review are:
1. Bagging.
2. Random Forest.
3. AdaBoost.
4. Voting.
5. Stacking.

These are 5 algorithms that you can try on your problem in order to lift performance. A
standard machine learning classification problem will be used to demonstrate each algorithm.
Specifically, the Ionosphere binary classification problem. 

1. Open the Weka GUI Chooser
2. Click the Explorer button to open the Weka Explorer
3. Load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/ionosphere.arff data
4. Click Classify to open the Classify tab
