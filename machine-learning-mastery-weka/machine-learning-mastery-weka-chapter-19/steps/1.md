Ensemble algorithms are a powerful class of machine learning algorithm that combine the
predictions from multiple models. A benefit of using Weka for applied machine learning is that
it makes available so many different ensemble machine learning algorithms. In this lesson you
will discover how to use ensemble machine learning algorithms in Weka. After reading this
lesson you will know:
- About 5 top ensemble machine learning algorithms
- How to use top ensemble algorithms in Weka
- About key configuration parameters for ensemble algorithms in Weka
