In this lesson you discovered how to use ensemble machine learning algorithms in Weka.
Specifically you learned:
- About 5 ensemble machine learning algorithms that you can use on your problem.
- How to use ensemble machine learning algorithms in Weka.
- About the key configuration parameters for ensemble machine learning algorithms in
Weka.

#### Next
Now that you know how to use a large number of machine learning algorithms, you must know
how to effectively compare their performance. In the next lesson you will discover how you can
design controlled experiments to compare algorithm performance and statistical methods to
determine whether the differences in the results are significant.
