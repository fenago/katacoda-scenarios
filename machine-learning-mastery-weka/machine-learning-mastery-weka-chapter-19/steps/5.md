A key configuration parameter in bagging is the type of model being bagged. The default
is the REPTree which is the Weka implementation of a standard decision tree, also called
a Classification and Regression Tree or CART for short. This is specified in the classifier
parameter. The size of each random sample is specified in the bagSizePercent, which is a size as
a percentage of the raw training dataset. The default is 100% which will create a new random
sample the same size as the training dataset, but will have a different composition. This is
because the random sample is drawn with replacement, which means that each time an instance
is randomly drawn from the training dataset and added to the sample, it is also added back
into the training dataset (replaced) meaning that it can be chosen again and added twice or
more times to the sample.

Finally, the number of bags (and number of classifiers) can be specified in the numIterations
parameter. The default is 10, although it is common to use values in the hundreds or thousands.
Continue to increase the value of numIterations until you no longer see an improvement in the
model, or you run out of memory

1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Ionosphere dataset
You can see that with the default configuration that bagging achieves an accuracy of 91%
