Stacked Generalization or Stacking for short is a simple extension to Voting ensembles that can
be used for classification and regression problems. In addition to selecting multiple submodels,
stacking allows you to specify another model to learn how to best combine the predictions from
the submodels. Because a meta model is used to best combine the predictions of submodels,
this technique is sometimes called blending, as in blending predictions together. Choose the
Stacking algorithm:

1) Click the Choose button and select Stacking under the meta group
2) Click on the name of the algorithm to review the algorithm configuration
