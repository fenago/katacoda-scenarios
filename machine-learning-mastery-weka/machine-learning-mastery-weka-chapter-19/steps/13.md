As with the Vote classifier, you can specify the submodels in the classifiers parameter. The
model that will be trained to learn how to best combine the predictions from the submodel can
be specified in the metaClassifier parameter, which is set to ZeroR (majority vote or mean) by
default. It is common to use a linear algorithm like linear regression or logistic regression for
regression and classification type problems respectively. This is to achieve an output that is a
simple linear combination of the predictions of the submodels.

1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration.
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Ionosphere dataset.

You can see that with the default configuration that Stacking achieves an accuracy of 64%.
Again, the same as voting, Stacking achieved poor results because only the ZeroR submodel was
selected. Try selecting a collection of 5-to-10 different submodels and a good model to combine
the predictions.
