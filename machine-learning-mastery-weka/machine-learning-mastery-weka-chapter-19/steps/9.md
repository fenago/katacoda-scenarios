The weak learner within the AdaBoost model can be specified by the classifier parameter.
The default is the decision stump algorithm, but other algorithms can be used. A key parameter
in addition to the weak learner is the number of models to create and add in series. This can be
specified in the numIterations parameter and defaults to 10.

1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Ionosphere dataset

You can see that with the default configuration that AdaBoost achieves an accuracy of 90%
