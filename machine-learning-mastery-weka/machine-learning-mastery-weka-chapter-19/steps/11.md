The key parameter of a Vote ensemble is the selection of submodels. Models can be specified
in Weka in the classifier parameter. Clicking this parameter let’s you add a number of classifiers.

Clicking the Edit button with a classifier selected let’s you configure the details of that
classifier. An objective in selecting submodels is to select models that make quite different
predictions (uncorrelated predictions). As such, it is a good rule of thumb to select very different
model types, such as trees, instance-based methods, functions and so on. Another key parameter
to configure for voting is how the predictions of the submodels are combined. This is controlled
by the combinationRule parameter which is set to take the average of the probabilities by
default.
1. Click OK to close the algorithm configuration
2. Click the Start button to run the algorithm on the Ionosphere dataset

You can see that with the default configuration that Vote achieves an accuracy of 64%.
Obviously, this technique achieved poor results because only the ZeroR submodel was selected.
Try selecting a collection of 5-to-10 different submodels.
