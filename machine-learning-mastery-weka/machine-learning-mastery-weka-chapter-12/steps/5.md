Now that you know how to mark missing values in your data, you need to learn how to handle
them. A simple way to handle missing data is to remove those instances that have one or more
missing values. You can do this in Weka using the RemoveWithValues filter. Continuing on
from the above recipe to mark missing values, you can remove missing values as follows:

- Click the Choose button and select the unsupervised.instance.RemoveWithValues filter

- Set matchMissingValues to True
- Click the OK button to use the configuration for the filter
- Click the Apply button to apply the filter
