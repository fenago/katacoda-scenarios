The problem used for this example is the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. The Pima Indians dataset is a good basis for exploring
missing data. Some attributes such as blood pressure (pres) and Body Mass Index (mass) have
values of zero, which are impossible. These are examples of corrupt or missing data that must
be marked manually. You can mark missing values in Weka using the NumericCleaner filter.
The recipe below shows you how to use this filter to mark the 11 missing values on the Body
Mass Index (mass) attribute.

- Open the Weka Explorer
- Load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff dataset
- Click the Choose button and select the unsupervised.attribute.NumericCleaner filter
