Instances with missing values do not have to be removed, you can replace the missing values
with some other value. This is called imputing missing values. It is common to impute missing
values with the mean of the numerical distribution. You can do this easily in Weka using the
`ReplaceMissingValues` filter. Continuing on from the first recipe above to mark missing values,
you can impute the missing values as follows:

- Click the Choose button and select the unsupervised.attribute.ReplaceMissingValues
filter

- Click the Apply button to apply the filter to your dataset
- Click mass in the Attributes section and review the details of the Selected attribute

Notice that the 11 attribute values that were marked Missing have been set to the mean
value of the distribution
