The distribution of each attribute can be plotted to give a visual qualitative understanding of
the distribution. Weka provides these plots automatically when you select an attribute in the
Preprocess tab. We can follow on from the previous section where we already have the Pima
Indians dataset loaded.

- Click on the preg attribute in the Attributes pane and note the plot below the Selected
attribute pane.

You will see the distribution of preg values between 0 and 17 along the x-axis. The y-axis
shows the count or frequency of values with each preg value.
