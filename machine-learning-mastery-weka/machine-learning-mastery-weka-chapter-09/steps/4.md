The table below lists a number of descriptive statistics and their values A useful four
number summary is provided for numeric attributes including:
- Minimum value
- Maximum value
- Mean value
- Standard deviation

You can learn a lot from this information For example:
- The presence and ratio of missing data can give you an indication of whether or not you
need to remove or impute values
- The mean and standard deviation give you a quantified idea of the spread of data for each
attribute
- The number of distinct values can give you an idea of the granularity of the attribute
distribution
- Click the class attribute This attribute has a nominal type Review the Selected attribute
pane

We can now see that for nominal attributes that we are provided with a list of each category
and the count of instances that belong to each category. There is also mention of weightings,
which we can ignore for now. This is used if we want to assign more or less weight to specific
attribute values or instances in the dataset.
