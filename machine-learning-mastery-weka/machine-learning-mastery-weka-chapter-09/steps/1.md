It is important to take your time to learn about your data when starting on a new machine
learning problem. There are key things that you can look at to very quickly learn more about
your dataset, such as descriptive statistics and data visualizations. In this lesson you will
discover how you can learn more about your data in the Weka machine learning workbench by
reviewing descriptive statistics and visualizations of your data.

After reading this lesson you will know about:
- The distribution of attributes from reviewing statistical summaries.
- The distribution of attributes from reviewing univariate plots.
- The relationship between attributes from reviewing multivariate plots.
