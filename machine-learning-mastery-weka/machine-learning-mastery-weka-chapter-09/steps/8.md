Note the controls at the bottom of the screen. They let you increase the size of the plots,
increase the size of the dots and add jitter. This last point about jitter is useful when you have
a lot of dots overlaying each other and it is hard to see what is going on. Jitter will add some
random noise to the data in the plots, spread out the points a bit and help you see what is going
on. When you make a change to these controls, click the Update button to apply the changes.

For example, below are the same plots with a larger dot size that makes it easier to see any
trends in the data.
