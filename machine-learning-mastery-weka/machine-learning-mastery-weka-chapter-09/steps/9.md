In this lesson you discovered how you can learn more about your machine learning data by
reviewing descriptive statistics and data visualizations Specifically, you learned:
- That Weka automatically calculates descriptive statistics for each attribute
- That Weka allows you to review the distribution of each attribute easily
- That Weka provides a scatter plot visualization to review the pairwise relationships
between attributes
