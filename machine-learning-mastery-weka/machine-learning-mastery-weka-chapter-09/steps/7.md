So far we have only been looking at the properties of individual features, next we will look at
patterns in combinations of attributes. When attributes are numeric we can create a scatter
plot of one attribute against another. This is useful as it can highlight any patterns in the
relationship between the attributes, such as positive or negative correlations. We can create
scatter plots for all pairs of input attributes. This is called a scatter plot matrix and reviewing
it before modeling your data can shed more light on further pre-processing techniques that you
could investigate. Weka provides a scatter plot matrix for review by default in the Visualise tab.

Continuing on from the previous section with the Pima Indians dataset loaded, click the
Visualize tab, and make the window large enough to review all of the individual scatter plots.

You can see that all combinations of attributes are plotted in a systematic way. You can
also see that each plot appears twice, first in the top left triangle and again in the bottom right
triangle with the axes flipped. You can also see a series of plots starting in the bottom left and
continuing to the top right where each attribute is plotted against itself. These can be ignored.
Finally, notice that the dots in the scatter plots are colored by their class value. It is good to
look for trends or patterns in the dots, such as clear separation of the colors.
- Clicking on a plot will give you a new window with the plot that you can further play
with.
