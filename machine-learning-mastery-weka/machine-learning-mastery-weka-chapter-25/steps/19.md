We see that K=3 achieved the lowest error
- Click the Select button for the Test base and choose the lazy.IBk algorithm with K=3
as the new test base
- Click the Perform test button to rerun the analysis

We can see that K=3 is significantly different and better than all the other configurations
except K=1. We learned that we cannot trivially get a significant lift in performance by tuning k
of IBk. Further tuning may look at using different distance measures or tuning IBk parameters
using different views of the dataset, such as the view with selected features.
