The more time that you spend working through projects, the faster you will develop your skills
in applied machine learning. As such, it is important to work on a suite of different problem
types. In this project you will discover how to work through a regression problem in Weka,
end-to-end. After completing this project you will know:
- How to load and analyze a regression dataset in Weka.
- How to create multiple different transformed views of the data and evaluate a suite of
algorithms on each.
- How to finalize and present the results of a model for making predictions on new data.

Letâ€™s get started.
