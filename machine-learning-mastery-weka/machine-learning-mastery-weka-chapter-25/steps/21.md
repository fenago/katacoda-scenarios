It looks like the kernel with an exponent=3 achieved the best result. Set this as the Test
base and rerun the analysis.

The results with the exponent=3 are statistically significantly better than exponent=1, but
not exponent=2. Either could be chosen although the lower complexity exponent=2 may be
faster and less fragile.
