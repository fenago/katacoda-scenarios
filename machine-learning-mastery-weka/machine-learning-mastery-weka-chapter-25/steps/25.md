In this project you discovered how to work through a regression machine learning problem using
the Weka machine learning workbench. Specifically, you learned.
- How to load, analysis and prepare views of your dataset in Weka.
- How to evaluate a suite of regression machine learning algorithms using the Weka Experiment Environment.
- How to tune well performing models and investigate related ensemble methods in order to
lift performance.
