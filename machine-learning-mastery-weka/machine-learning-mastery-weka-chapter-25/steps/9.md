In this section we will create some different views of the data, so that when we evaluate
algorithms in the next section we can get an idea of the views that are generally better at
exposing the structure of the regression problem to the models. We are first going to create a
modified copy of the original housing.arff data file, then make 3 additional transforms of the
data. We will create each view of the dataset from our modified copy of the original and save it
to a new file for later use in our experiments.
