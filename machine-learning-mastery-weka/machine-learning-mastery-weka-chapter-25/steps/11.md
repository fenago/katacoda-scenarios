The first view we will create is of all the input attributes normalized to the range 0 to 1. This
may benefit multiple algorithms that can be influenced by the scale of the attributes, like
regression and instance-based methods.
1. Open the Weka Explorer.
2. Open the modified numeric dataset housing-numeric.arff.
3. Click the Choose button in the Filter pane and choose the unsupervised.attribute.Normalize
filter.
4. Click the Apply button to apply the filter.
5. Click each attribute in the Attributes pane and review the min and max values in the
Selected attribute pane to confirm they are 0 and 1.
6. Click the Save... button, navigate to a suitable directory and type in a suitable name for
this transformed dataset, such as housing-normalize.arff.
7. Close the Weka Explorer interface
