**Note:** This step has already been done. You can verify by running following commands and looking at file content:

`docker exec -it kali-desktop bash -c 'head -n 60 /root/Desktop/numeric/housing.arff'`{{execute}}

`docker exec -it kali-desktop bash -c 'head -n 60 /root/Desktop/numeric/housing-numeric.arff'`{{execute}}

The CHAS attribute is nominal (binary) with the values 0 and 1. We want to make a copy of
the original housing.arff data file and change CHAS to a numeric attribute so that all input
attributes are numeric. This will help with transforming and modeling the dataset.
- Locate the housing.arff dataset and create a copy of it in the same directory called
housing-numeric.arff.
- Open this modified file housing-numeric.arff in a text editor and scroll down to where
the attributes are defined, specifically the CHAS attribute on line 56.

Change the definition of the CHAS attribute from:

```
@attribute CHAS { 0, 1}
```

to:

```
@attribute CHAS real
```

The CHAS attribute is now numeric rather than nominal This modified copy of the dataset
housing-numeric.arff will now be used as the baseline dataset
