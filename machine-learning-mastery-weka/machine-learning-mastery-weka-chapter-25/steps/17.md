Two algorithms were identified in the previous section as performing well on the problem and
good candidates for further tuning: k-Nearest Neighbors (IBk) and Support Vector Regression (SMOreg). In this section we will design experiments to tune both of these algorithms
and see if we can further decrease the root mean squared error. We will use the baseline
housing-numeric.arff dataset for these experiments as there did not appear to be a large
performance difference between using this variation of the dataset and the other views.

- Tune k-Nearest Neighbors
- Tune Support Vector Machines
