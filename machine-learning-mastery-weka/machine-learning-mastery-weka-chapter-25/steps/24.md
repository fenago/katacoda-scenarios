We can create a final version of our model trained on all of the training data and save it to file.
1. Open the Weka Explorer and load the housing-numeric.arff dataset.
2. Click on the Classify tab.
3. Select the trees.RandomForest algorithm.
4. Change the Test options from Cross-Validation to Use training set.
5. Click the Start button to create the final model.
6. Right click on the result item in the Result list and select Save model. Select a suitable
location and type in a suitable name, such as housing-randomforest for your model.

This model can then be loaded at a later time and used to make predictions on new data.
We can use the mean and standard deviation of the model accuracy collected in the last section
to help quantify the expected variability in the estimated accuracy of the model on unseen data.
We can generally expect that the performance of the model on unseen data will be 3.14 plus or
minus (2 Ã— 0.64) or 1.28. We can restate this as the model will have an error between 1.86 and
4.42 in thousands of dollars.
