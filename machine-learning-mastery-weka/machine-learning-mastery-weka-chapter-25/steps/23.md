- The results suggest suggest that random forest may have the best performance Select
trees.RandomForest as the Test base and rerun the analysis

This is very encouraging, the result for RandomForest is the best we have seen on this problem
so far and the difference is statistically significant when compared to Bagging and REPtree. To
wrap this up, letâ€™s choose RandomForest as the preferred model for this problem. We could
perform model selection and evaluate whether the difference in performance of RandomForest is
statistically significant when compared to IBk with K=1 and SMOreg with exponent=3. This
is left as an exercise for the reader.

- Check Show std deviations to show standard deviations of the results
- Click the Select button for Displayed Columns and choose trees.RandomForest, click
Select to accept the selection This will just show the results for the Random Forest
algorithm
- Click Perform test to re-run the analysis

We now have a final result we can use to describe our model

We can see that the estimated error of the model on unseen data is 3.14 (thousands of
dollars) with a standard deviation of 0.64.
