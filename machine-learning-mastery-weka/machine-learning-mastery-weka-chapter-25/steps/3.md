This tutorial will walk you through the key steps required to complete a machine learning
project in Weka. We will work through the following steps:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Analyze the dataset.
3. Prepare views of the dataset.
4. Evaluate algorithms.
5. Tune algorithm performance.
6. Evaluate ensemble algorithms.
7. Present results.
