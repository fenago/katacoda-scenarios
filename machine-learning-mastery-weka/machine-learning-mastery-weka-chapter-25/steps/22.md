In the section on evaluating algorithms, we noticed that the REPtree also achieved good results,
not statistically significantly different from IBk or SMOreg. In this section we consider ensemble
varieties of regression trees using bagging. As with the previous section on algorithm tuning, we
will use the numeric copy of the housing dataset.

- Open the Weka Experiment Environment interface
- Click New to start a new experiment
- In the Experiment Type pane change the problem type from Classification to Regression
- In the Datasets pane add the housing-numeric.arff dataset
- In the Algorithms pane add the following algorithms:
    * trees.REPTree
    * trees.RandomForest
    * meta.Bagging

- Click on Run tab and click the Start button to run the experiment The experiment
should complete in just a few seconds
- Click on the Analyse tab Click the Experiment button to load the results from the
experiment
-  Change the Comparison field to Root_mean_squared_error.
