We are unsure whether all of the attributes are really needed in order to make predictions
Here, we can use automatic feature selection to select only those most relevant attributes in the
dataset
1. Open the Weka Explorer
2. Open the modified numeric dataset housing-numeric.arff
3. Click the Choose button in the Filter pane and choose the supervised.attribute.AttributeSelection
filter
4. Click the Apply button to apply the filter
5. Click each attribute in the Attributes pane and review the 5 chosen attributes
6. Click the Save button, navigate to a suitable directory and type in a suitable name for
this transformed dataset, such as housing-feature-selection.arff
7. Close the Weka Explorer interface
