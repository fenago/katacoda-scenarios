Letâ€™s design an experiment to evaluate a suite of standard regression algorithms on the different
views of the problem that we created
- Click the Experimenter button on the Weka GUI Chooser to launch the Weka Experiment Environment
- Click New to start a new experiment
- In the Experiment Type pane change the problem type from Classification to Regression
- In the Datasets pane click Add new and select the following 4 datasets:
    * housing-numeric.arff
    * housing-normalized.arff
    * housing-standardized.arff
    * housing-feature-selection.arff

- In the Algorithms pane click Add new and add the following 6 regression algorithms:
    * rules.ZeroR
    * functions.SimpleLinearRegression
    * functions.SMOreg
    * lazy.IBk
    * trees.REPTree
- Select IBk in the list of algorithms and click the Edit selected button
- Change KNN from 1 to 3 and click the OK button to save the settings
