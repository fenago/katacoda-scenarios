In this section we will tune the IBk algorithm. Specifically, we will investigate using different
values for the k parameter.

- Open the Weka Experiment Environment interface
- Click New to start a new experiment
- In the Experiment Type pane change the problem type from Classification to Regression
- In the Datasets pane add the housing-numeric.arff dataset
- In the Algorithms pane the lazy.IBk algorithm and set the value of the K parameter to
1 (the default). Repeat this process and add the following additional configurations for
the IBk algorithms:
	* lazy.IBk with K=3
	* lazy.IBk with K=5
	* lazy.IBk with K=7
	* lazy.IBk with K=9
