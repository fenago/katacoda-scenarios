We can see that all of the algorithms are skillful on all of the views of the dataset compared
to ZeroR. We can also see that our baseline for skill is 65.11% accuracy. Just looking at the raw
classification accuracies, we can see that the view of the dataset with missing values imputed
looks to have resulted in lower model accuracy in general. It also looks like there is little
difference between the standardized and normalized results as compared to the raw results
other than a few fractions of percent. It suggests we can probably stick with the raw dataset.
Finally, it looks like Logistic regression may have achieved higher accuracy results than the
other algorithms, letâ€™s check if the difference is significant.
