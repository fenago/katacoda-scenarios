filter.
2. Click the Apply button to apply the filter your dataset.
3. Click each attribute in the Attributes pane and review the number of missing values
for each attribute. You should see all attributes should have no missing values and the
distribution of attributes 2 to 6 should have changed slightly.
4. Click the Save... button, navigate to a suitable directory and type in a suitable name for
this transformed dataset, such as diabetes-missing.arff.
5. Close the Weka Explorer.
