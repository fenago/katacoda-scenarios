We noted in the previous section that some of the attribute have a Gaussian-like distribution.
We can rescale the data and take this distribution into account by using a standardizing filter.
This will create a copy of the dataset where each attribute has a mean value of 0 and a standard
deviation (mean variance) of 1. This may benefit algorithms in the next section that assume a
Gaussian distribution in the input attributes, like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
1. Open the Weka Explorer.
2. Load the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset data/diabetes.arff.
3. Click the Choose button in the Filter pane and choose the unsupervised.attribute.Standardize
filter.
4. Click the Apply button to apply the filter.
5. Click each attribute in the Attributes pane and review the mean and standard deviation
values in the Selected attribute pane to confirm they are 0 and 1 respectively.
6. Click the Save... button, navigate to a suitable directory and type in a suitable name for
this transformed dataset, such as diabetes-standardize.arff.
7. Close the Weka Explorer interface.
