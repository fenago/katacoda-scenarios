In the previous section we suspected some of the attributes had bad or missing data marked
with 0 values. We can create a new copy of the dataset with the missing data marked and
then imputed with an average value for each attribute. This may help methods that assume a
smooth change in the attribute distributions, such as Logistic Regression and instance-based
methods. First letâ€™s mark the 0 values for some attributes as missing.
1. Open the Weka Explorer.
2. Load the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff.
3. Click the Choose button for the Filter and select the unsupervised.attribute.NumericCleaner
filter.
4. Click on the filter to configure it.
5. Set the attributeIndices to 2-6
6. Set minThreshold to 0.1E-8 (close to zero), which is the minimum value allowed for each
attribute.
7. Set minDefault to NaN, which is unknown and will replace values below the threshold.
8. Click the OK button on the filter configuration.
9. Click the Apply button to apply the filter.
10. Click each attribute in the Attributes pane and review the number of missing values for
each attribute. You should see some non-zero counts for attributes 2 to 6.
