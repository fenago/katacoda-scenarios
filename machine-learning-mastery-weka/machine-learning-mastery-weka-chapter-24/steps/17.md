We can create a final version of our model trained on all of the training data and save it to file
1) Open the Weka Explorer and load the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff dataset
2) Click on the Classify
3) Select the functions.Logistic algorithm
4) Change the Test options from Cross-Validation to Use training set
5) Click the Start button to create the final model
6) Right click on the result item in the Result list and select Save model Select a suitable
location and type in a suitable name, such as diabetes-logistic for your model

This model can then be loaded at a later time and used to make predictions on new data.
We can use the mean and standard deviation of the model accuracy collected in the last section
to help quantify the expected variability in the estimated accuracy of the model on unseen data.
We can generally expect that the performance of the model on unseen data will be 77.47% plus
or minus (2 Ã— 4.39)% or 8.78%. We can restate this as between 68.96% and 86.25% accurate.
What is surprising about this final statement of model accuracy is that at the lower end, the
model is only a shade better than the ZeroR model that achieved an accuracy if 65.11% by
predicting a negative outcome for all predictions.
