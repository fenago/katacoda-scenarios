In this project you completed a binary classification machine learning project end-to-end using
the Weka machine learning workbench. Specifically, you learned.
- How to analyze your dataset and suggest at specific data transform and modeling techniques
that may be useful.
- How to design and save multiple views of your data and spot-check multiple algorithms
on these views.
- How to finalize the model for making predictions on new data and presenting the estimated
accuracy of the model on unseen data.

#### Next
Next in the final project, you will work through a regression machine learning problem. This is
the largest project and involves also using algorithm tuning and ensemble methods in an effort
to achieve improved model performance.
