The fastest way to get good at applied machine learning is to practice on end-to-end projects.
In this project you will discover how to work through a binary classification problem in Weka,
end-to-end. After completing this project you will know:
- How to load a dataset and analyze the loaded data.
- How to create multiple different transformed views of the data and evaluate a suite of
algorithms on each.
- How to finalize and present the results of a model for making predictions on new data.

Letâ€™s get started.
