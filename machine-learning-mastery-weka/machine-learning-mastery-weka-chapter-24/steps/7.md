Click the Visualize All button and letâ€™s review the graphical distribution of each attribute

We can notice a few things about the shape of the data:
- Some attributes have a Gaussian-like distribution such as plas, pres, skin and mass,
suggesting methods that make this assumption could achieve good results, like Logistic
Regression and Naive Bayes.
- We see a lot of overlap between the classes across the attribute values. The classes do not
seem easily separable.
- We can clearly see the class imbalance graphically depicted.
