Letâ€™s design an experiment to evaluate a suite of standard classification algorithms on the
different views of the problem that we created
- Click the Experimenter button on the Weka GUI Chooser to launch the Weka
Experiment Environment
- Click New to start a new experiment
- In the Datasets pane click Add new and select the following 4 datasets:
    * /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff (the raw dataset)
    * diabetes-normalized.arff
    * diabetes-standardized.arff
    * diabetes-missing.arff
- In the Algorithms pane click Add new and add the following 8 classification algorithms:
    * rules.ZeroR
    * bayes.NaiveBayes
    * functions.Logistic
    * functions.SMO
    * lazy.IBk
    * rules.PART
    * trees.REPTree
    * trees.J48
- Select IBk in the list of algorithms and click the Edit selected button
- Change KNN from 1 to 3 and click the OK button to save the settings

- Click on Run tab and click the Start button to run the experiment The experiment
should complete in just a few seconds
- Click on the Analyse tab Click the Experiment button to load the results from the
experiment
