Review the details about the dataset in the Current relation pane. We can notice a few things:
- The dataset has the name pima diabetes.
- There are 768 instances in the dataset. If we evaluate models using 10-fold cross-validation
then each fold will have about 76 instances, which is fine.
- There are 9 attributes, 8 input and one output attributes.
- Click on each attribute in the Attributes pane and review the summary statistics in the
Selected attribute pane.

We can notice a few facts about our data:
- The input attributes are all numerical and have differing scales. We may see some benefit
from either normalizing or standardizing the data.
- There are no missing values marked.
- There are values for some attributes that do not seem sensible, specifically: plas, pres,
skin, insu, and mass have values of 0. These are probably missing data that could be
marked.
- The class attribute is nominal and has two output values meaning that this is a two-class
or binary classification problem.
- The class attribute is unbalanced, 1 positive outcome to 1.8 negative outcomes, nearly
double the number of negative cases. We may benefit from balancing the class values.
