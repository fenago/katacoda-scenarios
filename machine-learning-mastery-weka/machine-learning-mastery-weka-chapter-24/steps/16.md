It does look like the logistic regression results are better than some of the other results, such
as IBk, PART, REPTree and ZeroR, but not statistically significantly different from NaiveBayes,
SMO or J48.
- Check Show std deviations to show standard deviations
- Click the Select button for Displayed Columns and choose functions.Logistic, click

We now have a final result we can use to describe our model

We can see that the estimated accuracy of the model on unseen data is 77.47% with a
standard deviation of 4.39%
