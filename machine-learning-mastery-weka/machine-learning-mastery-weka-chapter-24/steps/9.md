We noted in the previous section that this may be a difficult problem and that we may benefit
from multiple views of the data. In this section we will create varied views of the data, so
that when we evaluate algorithms in the next section we can get an idea of the views that are
generally better at exposing the structure of the classification problem to the models. We are
going to create 3 additional views of the data, so that in addition to the raw data we will have 4
different copies of the dataset in total. We will create each view of the dataset from the original
and save it to a new file for later use in our experiments.
