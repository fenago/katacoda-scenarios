In this lesson you discovered how to finalize your model and make predictions for new unseen
data. You can see how you can use this process to make predictions on new data yourself.
Specifically, you learned:
- How to train a final instance of your machine learning model.
- How to save a finalized model to file for later use.
- How to load a model from file and use it to make predictions on new data.
