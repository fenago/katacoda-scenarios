This tutorial is broken down into 4 parts:

1) Finalize Model where you will discover how to train a finalized version of your model
2) Save Model where you will discover how to save a model to file
3) Load Model where you will discover how to load a model from file
4) Make Predictions where you will discover how to make predictions for new data

The tutorial provides a template that you can use to finalize your own machine learning
algorithms on your data problems. We are going to use the Pima Indians Onset of Diabetes
dataset. We are going to finalize a
logistic regression model on this dataset, both because it is a simple algorithm that is well
understood and because it does very well on this problem.
