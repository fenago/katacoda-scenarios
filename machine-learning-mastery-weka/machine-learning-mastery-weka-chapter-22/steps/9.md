- Uncheck the information we are not interested in, specifically:
    * Output model
    * Output per-class stats
    * Output confusion matrix
    * Store predictions for visualization

The predictions for each test instance are then listed in the Classifier Output pane. Specifically
the middle column of the results with predictions like tested positive and tested negative. You
could choose another output format for the predictions, such as CSV, that you could later load
into a spreadsheet like Excel. For example, below is an example of the same predictions in CSV
format.
