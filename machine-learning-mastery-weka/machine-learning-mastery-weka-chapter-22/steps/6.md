Continuing on from the previous section, we need to save the finalized model to a file on your
disk. This is so that we can load it up at a later time, or even on a different computer in the
future and use it to make predictions. We wonâ€™t need the training data in the future, just the
model of that data. You can easily save a trained model to file in the Weka Explorer interface.

- Right click on the result item for your model in the Result list on the Classify tab
- Click Save model from the right click menu

- Select a location and enter a filename such as logistic, click the Save button

Your model is now saved to the file logistic.model. It is in a binary format (not text) that
can be read again by the Weka platform. As such, it is a good idea to note down the version of
Weka you used to create the model file, just in case you need the same version of Weka in the
future to load the model and make predictions. Generally, this will not be a problem, but it is a
good safety precaution. You can close the Weka Explorer now. The next step is to discover
how to load up the saved model.
