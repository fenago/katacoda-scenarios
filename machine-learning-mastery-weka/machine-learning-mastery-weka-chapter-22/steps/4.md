Perhaps the most neglected task in a machine learning project is how to finalize your model.
Once you have gone through all of the effort to prepare your data, compare algorithms and tune
them on your problem, you actually need to create the final model that you intend to use to
make new predictions. Finalizing a model involves training the model on the entire training
dataset that you have available.
