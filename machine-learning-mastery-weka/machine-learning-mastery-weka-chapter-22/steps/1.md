After you have found a well performing machine learning model and tuned it, you must finalize
your model so that you can use it to make predictions on new data. In this lesson you will
discover how to finalize your machine learning model, save it to file and load it later in order to
make predictions on new data. After reading this lesson you will know:
- How to train a final version of your machine learning model in Weka.
- How to save your finalized model to file.
- How to load your finalized model later and use it to make predictions on new data.
