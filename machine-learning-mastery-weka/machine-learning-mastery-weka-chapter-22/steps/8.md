We can now make predictions on new data. First, letâ€™s create some pretend new data. Make a
copy of the file /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff and save it as /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes-new-data.arff.
- Open the file in a text editor.
- Find the start of the actual data in the file with the @data on line 95.
- We only want to keep 5 records. Move down 5 lines, then delete all the remaining lines of
the file.

The class value (output variable) that we want to predict is on the end of each line. Delete
each of the 5 output variables and replace them with question mark symbols (?)

We now have unseen data with no known output for which we would like to make predictions.
Continue on from the previous part of the tutorial where we already have the model loaded.

- On the Classify tab, select the Supplied test set option in the Test options pane
