This will train the chosen Logistic regression algorithm on the entire loaded dataset. It will
also evaluate the model on the entire dataset, but we are not interested in this evaluation. It is
assumed that you have already estimated the performance of the model on unseen data using
cross-validation as a part of selecting the algorithm you wish to finalize. It is this estimate you
prepared previously that you can report when you need to inform others about the skill of your
model. Now that we have finalized the model, we need to save it to file.
