The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos
as either containing a dog or cat. Although the problem sounds simple, it was only effectively
addressed in the last few years using deep learning convolutional neural networks. While the
dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to
develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification
from scratch.

This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the
model, how to explore improvements to the model, and how to save the model and later load it to
make predictions on new data. In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a convolutional
neural network to classify photos of dogs and cats. 

After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- How to load and prepare photos of dogs and cats for modeling.
- How to develop a convolutional neural network for photo classification from scratch and
improve model performance.
- How to develop a model for photo classification using transfer learning.

Let’s get started.
