Object detection is a task in computer vision that involves identifying the presence, location,
and type of one or more objects in a given photograph. It is a challenging problem that involves
building upon methods for object recognition (e.g. where are they), object localization (e.g.
what are their extent), and object classification (e.g. what are they). In recent years, deep
learning techniques are achieving state-of-the-art results for object detection, such as on standard
benchmark datasets and in computer vision competitions. Notable is the You Only Look Once,
or the YOLO, family of Convolutional Neural Networks that achieve near state-of-the-art results
with a single end-to-end model that can perform object detection in real-time. In this tutorial,
you will discover how to develop a YOLOv3 model for object detection on new photographs.
After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- YOLO-based Convolutional Neural Network family of models for object detection and the
most recent variation called YOLOv3.
- The best-of-breed open source library implementation of the YOLOv3 for the Keras deep
learning library.
- How to use a pre-trained YOLOv3 to perform object localization and detection on new
photographs.
Let’s get started.
