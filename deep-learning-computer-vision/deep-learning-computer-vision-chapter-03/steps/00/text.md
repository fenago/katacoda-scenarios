Below is an overview of the 5 steps in the neural network model life-cycle in Keras:
1. Define Network.
2. Compile Network.
3. Fit Network.
4. Evaluate Network.
5. Make Predictions.


#### Standard Network Models
When getting started with the functional API, it is a good idea to see how some standard
neural network models are defined. In this section, we will look at defining a simple Multilayer
Perceptron, convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network. These examples will
provide a foundation for understanding the more elaborate examples later.
