The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for several notebooks. Open and run `09_mtcnn_face_detection_plot_landmarks2.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/09_mtcnn_face_detection_plot_landmarks2.ipynb


**Note:**
Since deep learning algorithms are resource extensive. Please **shutdown** each notebook after running it [here](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work) before proceeding as shown below:

Select green(running) notebooks and click `Shutdown`.
