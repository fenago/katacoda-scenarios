An increase in the number of filters used in the convolutional layer can often improve performance,
as it can provide more opportunity for extracting simple features from the input images. This is
especially relevant when very small filters are used, such as 3 × 3 pixels. In this change, we can
increase the number of filters in the convolutional layer from 32 to double that at 64. We will
also build upon the possible improvement offered by using ‘same’ padding

We can run the code now. Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `deep-learning-python/chapter_18/04_baseline_with_padding_more_filters.py` to view file.

#### Run Code
**Note:** It will take some time to complete.

Now, run the python code by running: `python 04_baseline_with_padding_more_filters.py`{{execute}}
