We can use our saved model to make a prediction on new images. The model assumes that new
images are grayscale, they have been segmented so that one image contains one centered piece
of clothing on a black background, and that the size of the image is square with the size 28 × 28
pixels. Below is an image extracted from the MNIST test dataset.

We can run the  code now. Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `deep-learning-python/chapter_18/07_predict_final_model.py` to view file.

#### Run Code
**Note:** It will take some time to complete.

Now, run the python code by running: `python 07_predict_final_model.py`{{execute}}
