Let's first setup VScode editor and clone repository. Clone the following repository by executing following command in the terminal.
`git clone https://github.com/athertahir/web-scraping-with-python.git`{{execute}}

Now, move in the directory which contains the source code.

`cd web-scraping-with-python/Chapter03`{{execute}}


**Note:**
- The supplied commands in the next steps MUST be run from your `web-scraping-with-python` directory. 
- Final code was already cloned from github for this scenario. You can just understand the application code in the next steps and run it using the instructions.
- Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `web-scraping-with-python/Chapter03` to view code files.
