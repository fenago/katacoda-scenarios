We will be exploring scraping-related tools and techniques, as we will also be deploying some scraping code. Features related to web exploration, Python libraries, element identification, and traversing are the major concepts we have learned about so far.

Web scraping is often a challenging and long process that requires an understanding of how the website is performing. A basic ability to understand and identify the backends or tools that are used to build a website will assist in any scraping task. This is also related to a process known as reverse engineering. In addition to this, identifying the tools for traversing and manipulating elements such as HTML tags is also required, and pyquery is one of them.

In the previous chapters, we explored XPath, CSS Selectors, and LXML. In this scenario, we will look into using pyquery, which has a jQuery-like ability that seems to be more efficient and, hence, easier to deal with when it comes to web scraping procedures.

In this scenario, you will learn about the following topics:

- Introduction to pyquery
- Exploring pyquery (major methods and attributes)
- Using pyquery for web scraping


A web browser (Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) is required for this chapter. We will be using the following Python libraries:

- pyquery
- urllib
- requests
